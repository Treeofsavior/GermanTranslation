QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000005	Somehow, we need to resolve our poor supplies and forces. {nl}Once we accomplish that we will be able to break through the forest, piece by piece.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000023	Someone was held captive. {nl} I have a feeling he's going to disappear...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000024	The sacred force created by the goddess has not completely disappeared. {nl}Will it be able to suppress this devastation? {nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000041	Can you please help me find Dominic's engagement ring? {nl} I'm currently undertaking a mission, so I won't be able to leave this spot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000042	I tell you, he acts like that even though I bought him a roughly similar one. So stingy...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000043	What is this ugly thing? Oh, could the ring be inside?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000044	A knife won't fit inside, and there's no other way to get it out.{nl}Right! Can't we burn it to retrieve what's inside?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000045	Just make sure to bring me ones that aren't too thick.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000046	This should be just right.{nl}Good. Now, how do I burn this while I am working and not get caught?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000047	There should be plenty of Dry Thorn Forest Wood at the edge of Ishisineti Cliff. {nl} I'm on patrol and don't have time, so I ask of you again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000048	Ah, you should be able to burn it secretly at the top of Ishisineti Cliff. {nl} This is my last request. You just need to make preparations for the fire.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000049	I will never again care for another's wedding ceremony.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000050	I'll just say I have to go to the bathroom and burn it secretly there.{nl}Thank you very much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000051	Soldier Poulter
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000052	My goodness, the order states to eliminate all of the monsters in this area!{nl}How am I supposed to handle this many enemies all by myself?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000053	It was too overwhelming to carry out the task just by myself.{nl}However, I'm really fortunate since you decided to help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000054	I could almost cry my eyes out!{nl}Thank you very much for your help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000055	Commander Julian

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000058	Commander O'Rourke
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000059	Very impressive.{nl}Looks like I'll have to buy Julian a drink.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000060	It occurred to me while watching Ironbaum. {nl} What an exceptional companion it could be.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000061	O'Rourke's unit has been exhausted through big and small battles with Ironbaum.{nl}It would be very reassuring if you could become our strength.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000062	Substitute Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000063	I want to help purify the thorny forest, but I'm not strong enough. Could you eliminate the Tree Ghouls bothering the soldiers?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000064	It would be nice if more people could come and go using this road like before.{nl}I find people very interesting.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000065	Thank you. I hope I'm not giving you needless trouble all because of my aspirations.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000066	Alright. We haven't received any word from our forces at Niurus Highway.{nl}I request you find them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000067	If you can't find them, return to us.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000069	There are still a few of our colleagues further in.{nl}Please help us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000070	Soldier Dainus
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000071	Ironbaum attacked us at the Drieza Waterland.{nl}There are still soldiers left that have not yet escaped.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000072	I'm embarrassed to have escaped by myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000073	Settled Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000074	I have something to ask from you.{nl}I'm worried about the soldiers who are being hurt by the Ravinelarvae.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000075	Thank you.{nl}From now on, can our soldiers work comfortably?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000076	I appreciate your kind help.{nl}One day, I will return this favor when I meet your soul form.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000077	Are you the famous Revelator?{nl}Good, I'm puzzled with something. I need your help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000078	Ah, now I've received the order.{nl}Return to Commander Julian.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000079	I'm collecting information about Ironbaum.{nl}In order to reach the Gateway of the Great King, we have to defeat this monster first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000080	Thank you.{nl}Come back after taking this order to Poulter at Zaizda Hill.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000081	Give me back the good old times.{nl} When there were no thorns.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000082	If the path to the Gateway of the Great King is safe then I will be able to see more people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000083	Over all this time, I've seen it all.{nl}Now, I want only joy to be seen.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000084	Why do human souls contain so many things?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000085	If we run into monsters, we'll have no choice but to fight.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000086	We're working to reach the Gateway of the Great King.{nl}Have you heard the news about Ironbaum?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000087	In order to be a group leader, you need unwavering principles.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000088	It's true that trying to reach the Gateway of the Great King is reckless.{nl}However, we can't disobey the order.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000089	It may seem bad at first, but the two commanders have a surprisingly good relationship.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000090	I feel so lonely since no one is here.{nl}It's been a long time since I met new faces.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000091	What do you want to do here in this empty forest? No way, the way is available?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000092	Thank you.{nl}The soldiers and my colleagues will now be able to sleep comfortably.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000093	I can't feel my arms and legs.{nl}I feel so strange even though It's not cold.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000094	We must defeat Gaigalas.{nl}Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep in peace.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000095	We will start the hunt for Gaigalas soon.{nl}I'm so excited.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000096	This grudge is so sad.{nl}It's sad that we are powerless to stop it either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000097	Losses will continue unless somebody stops the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000098	Joint Investigation Unit Member Frey
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000099	I'm Frey.{nl}Listening to the story, the situation sounds bad.{nl}If the information you and Scott researched is correct.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000100	{nl}Then, I will have to do something.{nl}Please defeat some Red Vubbes first. They have been bothering me lately.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000101	Please, I ask of you...{nl}I get sick just looking at the red color.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000102	Oh, did you really defeat them for me?{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000103	I got something after talking with Scott.{nl}Something like a moving Woodsman piece of tree sculpture.{nl}Is it somehow related with the bark of a tree that the Vubbes got?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000104	By the way, there is still no news from Scott about a second report.{nl}I wonder what happened to him? Hmm...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000105	Wow, great!{nl}I owe you one. Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000106	Right? So I will ask you.{nl}Woodsmen are appearing on the Deer Hoot Site along with the left side of the path.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000107	I will take this combined result of the information Scott gave me and this fragment to my superior. {nl}By the way, There is still no news from Scott. Even the time Scott promised has long since passed. Just using the hearsay is not enough for the other investigator?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000108	Could you pick up the report from Scott?{nl}Do not forget to scold him for skipping work!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000109	Please handle Scott's report. Okay?{nl}Sometimes, he is stupid, but he is also cute.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000110	I have no face. Nowadays, I have been investigating everywhere to find something..{nl}Thanks a lot. If you are not..{nl}Ah, I don't want to think about it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000111	Oops, there's no time for this.{nl}I'm sorry, Please give it to Frey instead of me.{nl}I don't know where to start to clean the mess that Vubbes did..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000112	Ah, it is the report! {nl}Good, and what was Scott doing?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000113	Really? He couldn't handle a single Vubbe and got in trouble instead.{nl}Such a shame..I will scold him later!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000114	Everything is messy. {nl}I can not concentrate as the Vubbes.{nl}He must laugh, If he look at it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000115	Joint Investigation Unit Member Frey
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000116	It is still in progress to find the truth of the events.{nl}Take it. It's a soul collection scroll.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000117	Once you defeat the Red Vubbe using this scroll, the soul of Vubbe should be out?{nl}I'll have you collect it for me. Then, the data are almost done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000118	Do not forget the order.{nl}You have to defeat the Red Vubbes after using the soul collection scroll on them. Alright?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000119	About the bark of a tree that the Vubbe got.{nl}I think I can combine it using something like a spirit..{nl}Well, Please tell this news to Ukirt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000120	Joint Investigation Unit Member Ukirt
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000121	Scott and Frey did a good job. What do you think of it?{nl}I don't think so that Vubbe can't create themself.{nl}I will have to check what they do using this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000122	There may be something inside the supply boxes that the soldiers left a long time ago.{nl}You will find some old supply boxes up there.{nl}Can you go there and check? If we obtain some clues there, we may get an answer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000123	If you go back the way you just came, you will see an observatory tower on the hills.{nl}I hope the monsters haven't touch it yet..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000124	Are they really planning something?{nl}Something.. is suspicious..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000125	The Vubbes broke the supply boxes and ran away with this?{nl}Why? Were they really making it?{nl}No way, they aren't smart enough to do that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000126	Good! We should pay attention and solve the problem!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000127	Okay. Are you ready?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000128	Before you came, I saw Vubbes moving in groups.{nl}Go to Gebene Cliffs and see how the situation is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000129	The Vubbes were always involved with anything that happened here.{nl}It can't be just a coincidence..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000130	I think.. I understand now. {nl}I think that was like a big factory creating huge monsters called Woodspirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000131	The flag of Vubbes must have called in the ghosts.{nl}Then they polluted the trees and created huge monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000132	That tree barks must have been the ingredients for making Woodspirits.{nl}There's no way those Vubbes could do it alone.{nl}They must have received an order from somebody!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000133	We may find some decisive evidence at the place where the Vubbes are grouped together.{nl}If Prey sees this, it will like it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000134	Vubbes are not very smart so he must have made only simple orders.{nl}How could he think about controlling those Vubbes..{nl}I don't know what to say. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000135	I am sure that Woodspirits are created from various places.{nl}I can sense vicious energies coming. {nl}We should first destroy the flags that are creating Woodspirits!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000136	Leave as soon as you are ready. {nl}The best course of action for now is to stop the creation of Woodspirits..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000137	I think we've done our best for now. {nl}Since we can't do anything about the ones that were already created.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000138	I can feel the closest flag from here is near Gatves Highway.{nl}The huge trees that people saw is probably Woodspirits.{nl}How could I miss this simple thing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000139	Earnest Owl Chief Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000140	Thank you so much. {nl}The other owls must have gained confidence because of you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000141	Weak Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000142	It really was too late..{nl}The goddess really can be harsh sometimes..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000143	I have one last request. {nl}Can you burn the Owls so they could rest in peace?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000144	Do you think my allies can reach Goddess Ausrine safely?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000145	Thank you so much. {nl}First bring me the Oil from Oil Boxes on the way to Neuoder Field.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000146	If you are okay with it, I'd like to get some more help from you.{nl}I've sent a messenger, but due to the last attack, I am now worried about him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000147	That messenger should be safe... but I still worry for him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000148	Thank you so much.{nl}He must be there by now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000149	The squad was dispatched to recover Kateen Forest from the monsters.{nl}The entrance here to Kateen Forest is safe compared to other areas. The other areas are yet to be recovered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000150	As you go deeper inside, there are a number of soldiers along the way lacking in supplies.{nl}If a well known person like you can help them, it will be a great help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000151	Fallen Messenger
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000152	This is my fault, for assuming the entrance to Kateen Forest was secure.{nl}I will go back to the camp after taking a short rest.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000153	Ah, this is my bag.. thank you for saving me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000154	Only you can help me right now.{nl}Can you tell Felix that the operation at Peledos Crossroads has already started?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000155	There are many strange things that can't be seen in forests other than Kateen Forest.{nl}Such as the wooden owl sculptures.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000156	The operation? Oh, what an ignorant messenger.{nl}I can get that from the camp... Thanks anyway.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000157	Oh, the way back is dark, so it would be appreciated if you could light up the bonfire again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000158	You can't see much sunlight in Kateen Forest due to the enormous amount of trees.{nl}It seems like ghosts could come out at any moment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000159	Okay, so the messenger is safe?{nl}This place has been well taken care of thanks to your efforts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000160	I shall take some rest here.{nl}Is there a good place to hide?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000161	For letting Saltistter come in this far behind our lines, I should scold the person in charge of guarding this place.{nl}Thanks anyways. You sure live up to your reputation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000162	Guard Lyle
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000163	I lost many colleagues through the Petrifying Frost.{nl}I don't understand why I am here to support a newbie Chronomancer... so inefficient.{nl}On top of that, we don't know when those violent monsters would attack here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000164	If you are okay, can you get rid of the monsters while we are protecting here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000165	It is very unfortunate that we should take care of that woman this time.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000169	My old friend, Galen is one of the victims.{nl}Please protect him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000170	Thank you so much. I hope the reinforcement comes soon so he could return to his family even if he is petrified.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000173	The one who was caught last time told us that the stone statues were talking to him.{nl}Do you think that makes sense?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000176	A few days ago, we lost our supplies to Dico Thieves.{nl}They must have taken them to Drasos Chapel Ruins, but since I can't leave this place, I guess we're all gonna die.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000177	Can you retrieve the lost supplies?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000178	A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp and stole the supplies secretly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000179	They lured us in front of them and stole the objects from behind so there was no way we could prevent them from stealing.{nl}They wanted to take the objects legally so they were sent to gallows.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000180	The number of Dico Thieves is growing.{nl}They are very close to monsters. I don't know if they train those monsters or if there is something that I don't know yet.{nl}I heard the Knights of Kaliss was attacked by them.{nl}Maybe they are going after Sabina.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000184	A few weeks ago, the colleagues who used to work here received damage by Petrifying Frost and became stone statues at the square. {nl}The reason why the colleagues received damage was because they were engaged in eliminating traps that the thieves had set, but could not avoid them.{nl}There are still many traps around. We recently found one of them. Can you get rid of it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000185	The number of Dico Thieves may be more than the number of guards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000186	You caught monsters outside the thieves' area. I am sorry that you had to go through such a dangerous job.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000192	Use the magnifying glass of time near Pergale Highway. You should be able to see the past.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000206	Rebel Commander Ruklys, and the citizens here engaged in an evil conduct{nl}despite the selections from the great merchant, Premier Eminent. The result is this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000207	That's not bad. Maybe the guards can use it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000208	After Medzio Diena, the Petrifying Frost are occurring irregularly.{nl}Due to irregular Petrifying Frost, we lost many of our soldiers on this wasteland.{nl}And we set the petrification devices limitedly here at the square of lamentation and we check the frequency of the frosts and move out the soldiers accordingly.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000210	There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the devices. Be careful.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000213	If you are the Revelator, you will have no problem fighting against it.{nl}But, not here in area A. The exhausted soldiers may get involved in it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000214	Use this absorption scroll to temporarily get rid of the Petrifying Frost that're starting to form in area A. {nl}The Sparnashorn will then appear from the Petrifying Frost in area B.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000215	These guards had their lives threatened by the Sparnashorn and Petrifying Frost. {nl}They are blinded by fear so they don't stand a chance fighting against it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000216	The Petrifying Frost is gone, but only temporarily.{nl}There is no way we can stop the punishments Ruklys will bring no matter what we do.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000217	Are you ready? It's time to defeat the Sparnashorn. {nl}But we don't have enough time.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000221	The kind of work I do is business secret so I can't tell you what it is... {nl}No one owns these things anyway. Finders keepers if you need it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000222	That fast? Have you not missed any of them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000223	Aren't you curious how I made it through the strict security? {nl}It's all becuase I have connections. There are some Royal Army guards who buy xxx claws to raise their work records. {nl}But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially with A's.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000224	Can you catch them and get me those claws?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000225	I think you misunderstood. We are archeologists, not thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000226	This seems quite pricey. {nl}Thank you very much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000227	You better stop if you're planning to get something from the Petrified City. {nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Dico Thieves. {nl}But you might be at least rewarded if you help us out.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000228	In area A, there is a box that contains things the Dico Thieves bring in from outside. Can you get them? {nl}I took a sneak peek and seems like they are not back yet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000229	They are really clever. {nl}They bring in cheap antiques and place them where the Petrifying Frost blows. {nl}Then the antiques would petrify and turn into something that looks exquisite. {nl}I heard the nobles in big cities are fooled and buy them at expensive prices.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000230	Seems like the Dico Thieves are planning to make their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the Royal Army?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000231	Petrified flowers are sold at very high prices among novice sculptors. {nl}They look at this to make counterfeits but they don't know where it is from. {nl}It wouldn't do any good to know anyway...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000235	I have a friend who's supposed to come here but he's nowhere to be found. You didn't think I'd work alone in this huge area, did you? {nl}I think something happened.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000236	He is hiding among the guards in Security Area. This Water Bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000237	Better work on it quickly because the Petrifying Frost just sweeped by. {nl}You can know when and where the Petrifying Frost starts if you observe the Royal Army's retreat. {nl}And the fastest way to get that information is by becoming a Royal Army guard.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000238	Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000239	Did that stupid Hubertas send you here? {nl}I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here. {nl}I didn't know his stupidity would send someone. {nl}There is a big problem here actually.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000240	Our family can't come into the city from outside. {nl}We need your help. {nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing. {nl}They should all be gone from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000241	I'm going to make a big fuss in area A. I'm going to call in Saltistter that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gather Scented Stone Powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000242	Our families should have passed this place earlier than the Royal Army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Petrifying Frost swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000243	This is exactly right. {nl}If you pour this here, you will soon see the Saltistter show up it's huge self. {nl}But that is not our plan!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000244	We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through. {nl}Let's think for a while...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000245	Apply this powder on x monster that appear in area B. {nl}Then the bewitched Saltistter will attack them. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000246	Our families come from various areas. I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist. {nl}Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map 4 years ago on Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000247	Did you use everything? {nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000248	Go to Retia and tell her that Saltistter is coming. {nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Saltistter running at us. {nl}Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000249	You just have to tell her that Saltistter is coming. {nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000250	Our families passed through this place thanks to you. {nl}You will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area. {nl}And you may also meet our families. But be careful of the Dico Thieves. {nl}Unlike us, they were robbers from the beginning.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000251	Guard Gofden
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000252	I don't want to be here either. There's really no need to guard this place. {nl}Orders came in to support the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000253	Can you help me? {nl}Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place but the monsters are running wild so I can't just stay put.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000254	The officers don't like the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, Knights of Kaliss give us supplies and support so there's no reason for us to hate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000255	When I first came here, we just had to be careful of the Petrifying Frost but since Medzio Diena four years ago, every day is a crisis. {nl}I'm going to apply to move out when I'm done here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000256	It hasn't been that long for the Royal Army to enter this area by the request of Kostas. {nl}Much of the city remained in it's original form 600 years after the misfortune. {nl}One of my missions here is to clear the records of rebels remaining here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000257	I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here. Can you take care of it for me? {nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area and Parduo square area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000258	Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000259	I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000260	A few days before I was dispatched here, many soldiers came to this place to do a preliminary check for the research of Knights of Kaliss. {nl}But no one returned. They were attacked by the irregular Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000261	I was ordered to take back their keepsakes but it's hard just to think about it. {nl}Can you help me out?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000262	The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the Royal Army and the Knights of Kaliss have become distant.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000263	You may not believe it but I might have been standing there too. {nl}Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it. {nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000264	How are you traveler, although, I don't know why you are passing through this place...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000265	Ah, so you are the famous Revelator. I've heard a lot about you from my colleagues in Klaipeda. {nl}They say you go around to save the world according to the will of the goddess?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000266	Then let me make a good offer, I found a way to turn back this Petrified City. Can you help me? {nl}First, get rid of the monsters around here. I have to be safe first before I can tell you anything, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000267	The Cryomancers in Klaipeda are stubborn and arrogant. If you feel something like that from me, then that's your delusion. {nl}There is Cryomancer as humane and warm-hearted as me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000268	Did you dry the seeds? Good, anyway.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000269	Now, the next test is for you to take this and test if it's usable while I find the formula of magic circle. {nl}An Ice wall will appear if you use this so check how useful that is to the monsters. {nl}We need a safety net in order to test and this will do the job.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000270	The monsters will come attacking when the Ice wall is formed so take care of the rest of the monsters that you missed a while ago.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000271	The Petrifying Frost will not happen anymore for a while. {nl}Don't worry about that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000272	It's very effective! Now this should be able to block monsters or Revelators.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000273	Now we get to the important part. The most important part of the test is to find the Mark of Silk, a strong magic tool that can turn back petrified things. {nl}The stupid Royal Army lost the last Mark in this area 4 years ago so it's probably somewhere around here. {nl}It can also be inside the monster's stomach.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000274	Defeat the monsters and get the shiny stone from them. That will shine by itself so bring that and I will look for it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000275	The stupid Royal Army probably doesn't know how great that Mark is. {nl}Probably no one knows, except me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000276	Pray that the Mark of Silk is among these stones. {nl}If not, I will be really mad.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000277	Aha! It's here. Why wasn't the Royal Army able to find it when it is so easy like this? {nl}Are their heads only good for wearing helmets? Anyway, let's begin the test. Follow me to the magic circle I installed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000278	Hey friend, how did you get here? {nl}Are you looking for a job? {nl}I might sound a bit nosy but It's dangerous to go around alone. {nl}Of course, the same goes for anyone else too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000279	I need to work in the commercial area but I can't work alone because of the monsters. {nl}Can you help me out?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000280	It's a good thing the cowardly Dico Thieves did not come until here. {nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take it away...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000281	If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000282	I'm gonna go to Gerove Workshop. Can you help me out while I work? {nl}You jsut have to follow me around and fight the monsters while I do the work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000283	I got a load of it thanks to you. I won't have to go around for days. {nl}I plan to wait here until my colleagues arrive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000284	Please take care of the monsters and grave robbers in the Barracks District while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interrupted.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000285	It's relatively safe on top of the fortress. There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000286	You cleared the test areas. Good job.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000287	I will proceed the test from up here. {nl}Please go to the portal and prepare to test it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000288	Everything will be alright. It's all just visuals and it can't come across to this world.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000289	Something outrageous happened. What could those be? {nl}Chronomancers will not believe it. Did the past interfere with the future? Or the future interfere with the past?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000290	I better stay here and tune the portal leading to Final Battle Field.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000292	It hasn't been long since we cooperated with the grave robbers. {nl}Supporting them without the Royal Army knowing is like having your life on the line. {nl}But what can we do. We're just following orders. .
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000293	They will pass through the Downtown Street. {nl}Of course, they will face the monsters. A big commotion will happen and the guards will find them. {nl}I want you to get your hands on at that point. Unlike the Dico Thieves, they can't stand to be in debt so they will be helpful to your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000294	They are more than just a few so we don't know when they will pass through. {nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000295	Did you defeat the monsters? The guards were asking what the fuss is about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000296	Don't forget. Our helping the grave robbers here is a secret to the Royal Army. {nl}Your life can be on the line.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000297	We need to bring Stepnas to Downtown Street. {nl}He promised to get us the Frost Core which will help in studying the Petrifying Frost. {nl}We need to slip away the guards in order to do that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000298	The guards are unofficially receiving supples from the knights. Please coat it with the monster's scent. {nl}Then give it to the guards at the mouth of the river. This will cause a big commotion.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000300	Did the guards sense the scent? {nl}The monsters should have.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000301	The Stone Whale will soon attack the guards. {nl}Act like you're greeting them and lead them to vacate the crossroads. {nl}Then Stephonas will pass through without secretly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000302	Rofdel will be watching from the watchtower but on a foggy day like this, he won't take action.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000303	Stephonas passed through safely. {nl}He was looking for you. Go and help him. {nl}The guards won't mention our names to Rofdel. {nl}What they have been taking until now was all against the military law.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000304	The headquarters are collecting old records that the Royal Army weren't able to clean up. {nl}Since you've seen it a few times yourself, did you sense something fishy?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000305	The Royal Army spreading promotional materials praising the great prime minister of the past, Premier Eminent, and the grave robbers. {nl}Please get that leaflet. There will be a loophole if we compare it with the historical data we've collected.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000306	The Royal Army have had difficulty recruiting since 4 years ago so they've been spreading out leaflets like this to the nomads outside the fallen city or the grave robbers for them to apply. {nl}Of course, they will just be treated like slaves when the world becomes better to live.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000307	So, this is what it says. They made such embarassing stories sound like a heroic epic to the ignorant people. {nl}I will send this to the headquarters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000308	You're the one who made me an opportunity. {nl}You deserve applause for understanding and executing Hans' imprudent plans, but we have to stay quiet so just receive my thanks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000309	The reason I called you is to find the Frost Core that I've promised Kaliss knights. {nl}But I didn't know the guards are goind around like that! There's a change of plan.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000312	Ah, this will make a great explosion even with a small hit. Good! Wait a minute.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000313	To prevent this from exploding in your hands, you either have to make it a time bomb, or throw it. {nl}But you can't really find fuse around here and it wont light because of the dust. {nl}I will give you the processed stone gunpowder so throw it to the monsters. If you're lucky, it will create a big explosion without any noise and if not, it will make them angry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000314	If we can't get this done, we can't even start with the next step.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000315	It won't explode right away and explosion is not steady. What to do...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000316	In order to make it stick to the monster! and then explode with a BAM! then we need something with high viscosity. {nl}Can you get Sticky Liquid from the monsters in Viskas?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000320	Remember to stay away after you stick it on to it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000321	Maybe this time, it can even be seen from Fedimian.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000322	So this is the frost core that bothered many people... {nl}The soldiers who helped you will tell the guy watching from the watchtower about your heroic stories so they won't suspect you. {nl}Dont' worry.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000328	Reading stuff about the death throes of rebels gives us the chills.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000329	Got to break this one and use it to restore the watchtower. It's killing two birds with one stone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000330	The monsters that weren't able to run away from the Petrifying Frost are gathered in the demolished Amosi Port below the watchtower. {nl}Problem is that it's causing other monsters to gather. {nl}Some even act as though it's petrified and deceive the guards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000331	Can you take care of them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000332	In the past, this place was a big city that's not even comparable to Klaipeda or Fedimian.{nl}But when people left, monsters started to fill the place. {nl}From then, the monsters adjusted to the city in ways even smarter than humans.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000333	You know better about what the Royal Army should do than the army themselves. {nl}Do you have any thoughts on applying to the Royal Army? I'm just kidding.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000334	We lose a few soldiers whenever the Petrifying Frost sweeps by. {nl}The kingdom can't support for the lost soldiers so the number of our men to guard the area is decreasing. {nl}So we thought of an idea to train the refugees and grave robbers to become guards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000335	What we can do here is to post this leaflet around Downtown Street. {nl}Can you do it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000336	I'm sure people are taking the leaflets but the number of applicants have decreased recently. {nl}It's either the grave robbers started checking inside or the monsters think of it as food and are eating it. {nl}Isn't it suspicious?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000337	Thank you. If you serve the kingdom like Premier Eminent, I'm sure you will take an important role when the kingdom flourishes.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000342	You're as great as the rumors say. The Knights of Kaliss need heroes like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000343	Stone debris and dust blow a lot in this area so many soldiers and knights cough severely. {nl}The headquarters send us refreshing candies mixed with medicinal herbs. {nl}But our soldiers were swepted by the Petrifying Frost while carrying our supplies for this month and the monsters stole it all.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000345	I would like to give you some if we have extras. {nl}Even the grave robbers are preying on the candies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000346	I won't blame you if you eat one secretly. {nl}But you don't seem to be that kind of a person.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000347	Soldiers patrolling this area were swept by Petrifying Frost while passing by Stalactite square some time ago. {nl}We are only affiliated to Royal Army but we're mostly residents of Kaliss province. {nl}I want to help my folks from back home.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000348	But there is no way to get them out of the curse. {nl}We can only get their last will and keepsakes for their families. {nl}Won't you show your kindness for them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000349	I understand their loyalty for the kingdom but when I see them make people do impossible things that result to deaths, I don't know who is the monster anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000350	Nonsense! {nl}You mean all of them are gone? {nl}I'm sorry to have made you face such misfortune.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000351	In order to restore the city, the Knights of Kaliss are recruiting more men than their budget could handle. {nl}I was also recently hired to release the curse through spell. {nl}But they just recruit people without any support afterwards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000352	If my presumptions are correct, there is a high possibility that all of the things happening here are results of someone's sinister spell. {nl}In order to check, we need elixirs to drag out whoever it is. {nl}Can you defeat the monsters in Sacred port and get those?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000353	New methods always lead to new directions. {nl}I will lift this curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000354	That's enough ingredients to make the Liberation Elixir. {nl}Now, let's start.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000355	I will give you this Liberation Elixir. {nl}Use it on petrified guards or grave robbers. {nl}Their souls trapped in their body might tell you something about what they last witnessed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000356	The angry souls might attack you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000357	There was nothing worth noting save for the victims being overwhelmed with fear before their deaths.{nl}I guess I better look for even older victims.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000358	Before they die, petrified victims release evil thoughts.{nl}Please use the incense and the stone while the knights are gone and I'll be heading over. When enough of the evil thoughts have gathered, we can see what happened on that day.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000359	Please do not provoke them. You know how those guys get.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000360	This is some serious stuff. I should deliver it to the headquarters of the knights.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000361	It's not like paper or trees, it's a living thing that turned to stone and died...{nl}Where else would such astonishing things happen? I am very interested in this strange phenomenon.{nl}With your assistance, I might be able to help those who are still alive, with minimal injury.{nl}Well, they may lose a few fingers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000362	Can you try using this solvent on the monster? There must be some of them suffering from the stone curse.{nl}If we can use it on them, shouldn't it work on humans too?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000363	What do you think? Even if it works on just one or two of them, that would still be great.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000364	You weren't able to save any of them? {nl}I guess this is not a good way. I will take back what is left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000365	I think we should use different drugs and test as much as we can. {nl}But then we will need a lot of samples.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000366	Can you defeat the monsters in Neiveikiama Castle and get me petrified samples?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000367	I'm still thinking so can you come back later?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000368	This should be enough for about five tests. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000369	May those sacrificed rest in peace. However, like the river that attracts those who are thirsty, this place is astounding for me and my thirst for knowledge. {nl}But there is a foolish monster trying ruin this wonderful place. Can you take care of it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000370	It if has a brain, how can it go around ruining this? {nl}Oh well, maybe that's why it's a monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000371	Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000372	I heard about you from Wilhelmina. I heard you're good? But can you enter the Fortress of the Land without our help? {nl}You will need a pathfinder no matter how good you are. I will take you if you help me and Wilhelmina.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000375	Did you see the Gargoyle statue in the assembly area? It moves whenever I try to approach it so I can't get into Fortress of the Land.{nl}Wilhelmina says she has a tool to suppress it so you just have to hand over what you found and take that from her.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000376	Unlike other knights, Wilhelmina seems to have sensed something. {nl}We work in hand in gloves so it's been easier for use to do work around since Wilhelmina came here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000377	Now hand over these records to Wilhelmina and take that thing we need.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000378	Finally, the records untouched by the Royal Army have arrived. {nl}This is... a love letter? I don't need it so you can take it or throw it away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000379	Hmm... It contains most of what we need. I better send this to the headquarters. {nl}I will give you this vacuum scroll. Use this on the Gargoyle that bullies Amanda. {nl}No sound will transmit even if you have an explosion or thunder inside so the Royal Army will have no clue.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000380	The Knights of Kaliss have some very good wizards so they will give us what we need.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000381	It looks more pleasant than I expected. I thought she'd give us something like a ballista or a cannon. {nl}But I guess this would be the best for us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000382	Can you use that on the Gargoyle while I pack? {nl}I'm sure it will be easy enough for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000383	There is a monocle that helps you identify precious things and it will help us find the room of treasures easily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000384	The scroll Wilhelmina gave us is awesome!{nl}I didn't hear a thing even from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000385	Shall we go now?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000386	I'm a wizard who can't use any magic. I feel pathetic.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000392	Troops in the frontlines don't know what hardships we go through. {nl}They think that they're the only ones who have their lives on the line.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000406	But if you help me out, I will give you something. It may not be as great as what you broke but it's pretty good.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000407	It's nothing much, really. {nl}The symbol of pilgrim on the Starving Demon's Way outside Fedimian will do.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000408	Nevermind if you can't. {nl}But if you can, that'd be awesome.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000409	Oh, you got it... {nl}Well, aren't reckless challenges the fun in life?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000744	Monsters were around even before. {nl}But ever since that tree emerged in the capital, they began to destroy us. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000745	Do you think the end of the world is really coming?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000746	One... Two... Three... {nl}Yes, this should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000747	The Throneweaver likes Sakmoli Roots very much. {nl}If it smells a mix of both, it will jump out right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000748	This will be enough to lure it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000749	Now go back to Tomb Spider Nest again. {nl}Defeat it when it smells the bait and rushes in.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000750	Teach it a lesson so that it won't destroy the owls again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000751	Thank you. {nl}They will not dare to attack us now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000752	To the monsters, our magic powers provide them good nourishment. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000753	But we shouldn't end up like that. {nl}Who else will guide the souls then? {nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000771	That Owl Sculpture is not moving an inch. {nl}I heard they guide souls, but I don't think it's true.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000772	Good job. This will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000773	I will weave this wood to make it human-like. {nl}After this, the crisp skin of Old Kepa at Purple Fountain would be just right. Please do me another favor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000774	I've spent a long time without salvation. {nl}My men will also be saved if you defeat those monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000775	You've gathered the skin of the Old Kepas? This will be enough. Good.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000776	The decoy is ready. {nl}I'm sorry, but I want you to test this on the monsters at Uzesy Hill for me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000777	Run away if the decoy fails. {nl}I don't want you to become like me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000778	The decoy seems alright then. {nl}Follow me to Grobis Crossroads.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000779	Thank you for following me. {nl}Weave in some Ellom Leaves to finish the decoy with hair.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000780	Good work. Now it's time for revenge.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000784	Thank you. Thank you very much.{nl}First, please get some Legs of Solid Wood from the Bushspiders at Purple Fountain.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000785	Well. I don't know what I'm still doing here. {nl}That Owl that's supposed to guide us is not saying a word either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000786	Maybe we can go back to the goddess if we achieve what we were not able to. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000787	That fellow worries a lot. {nl}I said it's not Deadborn but he's still worrying like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000788	It's worth a shot if it's Saltistter. {nl}But if it's Deadborn, then I'm out of here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000789	I never heard of any Deadborn sightings in Kateen Forest.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000790	We had to go through so much to recapture this entrance to Kateen Forest. I don't think Deadborn will appear, would it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000791	The monsters' endless raids are tiring us. {nl}If you help us and break their assault, then my soldiers can cheer up.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000793	Thank you. I can feel relieved for the time being. {nl}Ah, if you see a soldier named Roy, please tell him to return.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000794	We didn't just stay put when we were sieged by the monsters. {nl}We sent out scouts to get away from here but no one came back. {nl}{NP}If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to search for them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000795	We need every man we have. {nl}I hope nothing happened to them...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000796	You're really trustworthy. {nl}They went up north.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000797	Were you sent by Danus? {nl}You're too late. The others were taken out already.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000798	The monsters will come to attack again soon. {nl}But I can't move right now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000799	You saved me. I won't ask you to bring me back to camp, though. {nl}Thank you for saving my life!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000800	This is a method I used when I was alive. {nl}It was mostly successful back then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000801	The Supply Squad should have arrived already, but they are late. {nl}I'm sure something happened to them. Can you search for them in the lower area?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000802	I'm sure we can find our way out of here if we can find the Supply Squad.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000803	Are you from the Rearguard Unit? {nl}I'm sorry we've been so late. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000804	But we are all very tired. {nl}If you want to help us get back to the Rearguard Unit Camp, please help us gather the scattered supplies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000805	All kinds of monsters attack us when we have supplies. {nl}We need more soldiers, but we haven't received any, no matter how much backup we requested.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000806	Thank you. {nl}This will be enough to cover for us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000807	Right now, it would be best for our troops to join with Danus' troops. {nl} We will join them soon after a little rest so please deliver them the food supplies first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000808	We are sorry for delivering the supplies late. {nl}But this is the situation of most supply troops.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000809	What happened? {nl}Is the Supply Squad well on their way? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000810	At least the food supplies were delivered first. {nl}Good work. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000811	Danus ordered me to return? {nl}I can't return until I collect a Puragi's Hook.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000812	My mission is more important than his order to return. {nl}If we were to consider priorities, I mean.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000813	Thank you for your help. {nl}But do I just return to Danus' troops?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000814	Have you seen a soldier named Roy? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000815	You mean you returned him to the Rearguard? {nl}That's bad. We're short on men. You are partly responsible for that now, so you better cooperate.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000816	Blood will be shed soon. {nl}I pity you for going in Roy's stead.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000817	So, just as I've heard. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000818	The next mission is to find my missing scouts. {nl}They were sent to Razygis Hill but have not returned for hours.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000819	The scout unit was attacked, myself included. {nl}I hope I can at least find the report to send to sir Philipas...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000820	Our squad is all dead because of my incompetence. {nl}I'm the only one alive but I don't think I have much time left either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000821	This report is completely soaked in blood and unreadable. {nl}I can't stand that my men's efforts were all for nothing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000822	There is one last favor I would like to ask you. {nl}The remains of my men are up in the hills. Please take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000823	I feel sorry for them being abandoned amongst the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000824	Thank you.{nl}My men can now rest in peace. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000825	Oh, I've found some readable parts from my men's reports. {nl}Please tell sir Philipas that the monsters will attack the regular troops soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000826	...Is that so? I guess it's too late for the scouts. {nl}I swear to treat them with respect. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000827	According to Johan's report, we better strike them from behind. {nl}I will meet you in Isdaigininko Highway.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000828	Revenge is best served cold. {nl}Even for Johan and his men.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000829	You're here. {nl}Are you ready? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000830	The battle has begun. Troops have entered Isdaigininko Highway already. {nl}It will be a big help if you fight with them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000831	The plan will not fail. {nl}I promise this to Johan's troops.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000832	It looks like you've done more than Roy's part. {nl}If it wasn't for you, we would not have been successful. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000833	I hope the blessings of the goddess are with you on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000834	I can't close my eyes before we defeat that monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000835	When will this pitiful feeling end. {nl}When I look at the souls, I don't think it will end.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000836	I can suffice with delayed supplies or reinforcements. {nl}But telling us to just wait around is too much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000837	I'm afraid where the monsters will jump out from. {nl}I plan to run away if an unknown monster shows up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000838	We're making up for the lacking supplies. {nl}If the supplies don't arrive, we have to cover for it on site.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000839	Somehow, at least sir Philipas' troops...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000840	There was another route that we used before. {nl}But it got like this when that gigantic tree suddenly emerged. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000841	We're clearing up this route to make it easy for supplies but.. {nl}As if the monsters isolating us was not enough, now there are no news of supplies, and the soldiers are becoming weary.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000842	I'll be grateful if you can do that. {nl}If you relieve us from their attacks, it might even boost the troop's morale.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000843	I want to let go of everything and just rest. {nl}But thinking of my men..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000844	The monsters are swallowing my companions. {nl}This never happened before that big tree emerged in the capital...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000845	There are more and more wandering souls, {nl}and souls that are suddenly disappearing. It's really scary.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000846	First, you have to find the hiding Throneweaver. {nl}Please gather Ridimed Leaves. The Throneweaver loves it. {nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000847	Good. {nl}First, defeat the Big Blue Grivas up the hills and put a damper on them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000848	I feel regretful. I can't close my eyes like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000849	I have a request. Please save my companions. {nl}They will be eaten if we don't save them quickly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000850	There is a monster's nest at the end of this road. {nl}My colleagues may still be alive there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000851	Thank you. {nl}My colleagues were taken to the nest at the end of the road.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000852	I can't feel the owl that guides the souls at Ishrai Crossroads. {nl}I'm worried that it may have been attacked by the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000853	I hope nothing happened to it...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000854	Monsters' attacks are becoming stronger and there is no news from the troops that went out. {nl}This is not good.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000855	Thank you. {nl}I thought I would lay dormant forever like this. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000856	It's confusing. {nl}There seems to be something with Lydia Schaffen and Ruklys... but they're still traitors, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000857	(You cannot read it because it's broken.)
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000858	We are after an unknown monster. {nl}I hope it's not Deadborn, but I feel like it is. Can you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000859	That's weird. I think I saw a Deadborn.. {nl}What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000860	Dear Revelator, please lend us your strength! {nl}We're fighting against Saltistter and us alone is not enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000861	You're great, as expected! Commander Vacenin wants to meet you. Go to the camp quickly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000862	Soldier Rudolfas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000863	Even if you're the Revelator, this place is too dangerous. {nl}Please go to a safe area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000864	What did I tell you? {nl}Thanks for your help but you should turn back quickly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000865	Soldier Aspas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000866	I was careless. {nl}It would be big trouble if the monsters attacked now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000867	You saved me. {nl}Do you know what happened to my colleagues?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000868	Meleech swallowed Dominic's engagement ring. {nl}I did lose it, it's really terrible.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000869	This place is too dangerous for citizens to go around. {nl}Go to a safe area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000870	I understand that you are strong but it's dangerous to go around alone here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000871	I could have supported O'Rourke and the troops, if only I was not injured...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000872	This place is dangerous. {nl}Especially with Ironbaum around, I have not seen such a violent monster before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000873	There are still many who have not yet returned. {nl}Do we really have to go through all this danger to clear a path to the Gorge Area...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000874	I'm safe thanks to my colleagues. {nl}I did not think we could defeat Ironbaum.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000875	Bishop Aurelius' Spirit
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000876	Revelator.. It was a long time. {nl}I have awaited centuries to guide you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000877	This Great Cathedral is a legacy of Maven, the first bishop, and a sanctuary with a revelation. {nl}But I am unable to leave this precise area. {nl}As it stands, I have no power to aid the holy mission.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000878	It has been worth the long wait. {nl}Although my body is like this, I am overflowing with emotion right now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000879	This will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000880	I believe a scripture will hold the Spirit Essences well enough. {nl}Unfortunately, they are all at Pamaldu Groom. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000881	Although I'm just a spirit, I have offered myself to the goddess. {nl}I want to be placed in a scripture.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000882	Are you done with the ritual? {nl}Check if this scripture can call me correctly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000883	Splendid. {nl}Now you must solve the secret of the Great Cathedral and get the revelation. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000884	Of course, there will be hardship. {nl}The burden of the holy mission will surely weigh down on your shoulders. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000885	But only you and the goddess can save this world..{nl}Even knowing my body would turn out like this, I desired to guide you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000886	Don't worry. You just have to finish the bowl to hold me. {nl}First, gather the Essence of Soul. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000887	Oh, the vessel should be completed at the Altar of Stability. {nl}I have spent centuries without a body, so I hope you get a decent scripture.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000888	It's simple. {nl}Use the scripture of soul in your inventory.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000889	Cleric
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000890	This Great Cathedral is like a repository of knowledge. {nl}Of course, that should mean that we can find how to release Naktis' curses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000891	I'm roughly done studying this area, but we need the reports of clerics from other areas. {nl}If you meet other clerics in the Great Cathedral, can you get their reports for me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000892	If we've got the reports, even Naktis' curse will just be as if it were a mere spell. {nl}Yup, that's right. Great work. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000893	Isn't it scary in here? {nl}Even the Owl Sculpture feels gloomy..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000894	I've heard about sightings of souls with resentment. {nl}If it's true.. Uhh, you're not one of them, are you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000895	Grave Keeper Romas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000896	Being a Revelator doesn't mean that you can roam around freely tomorrow as you do today.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000897	Every Revelator who said that they were different never really made it far.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000898	This is no place for civilians to pass by and it won't happen anytime soon. {nl}It's too dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000899	My colleagues are still inside. {nl}It's frustrating because there's no way to know what happened to them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000900	I can't forgive them for making the tower such a mess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000901	You better watch out. {nl}Why do you think even the wizards ran away?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000902	We can help Goddess Gabija if we have the Jewel of Prominence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000903	Now that the trasport magic circle is destroyed, we have to go head to head.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000904	I think I can remember something... But first, it's important to go to the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000905	Uhg, my head aches.. {nl}Maybe it's because of the crazy old man a while ago...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000906	This is endless. I want to just burn it all.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000907	I will make them pay for doing this to our tower!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000908	I can't stay down like this when you've helped so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000909	Even if the odds are against you, you can turn the tables if you make the perfect formation. {nl}But this is all useless for you if you enjoy solitude.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000910	They're all dead or ran away. {nl}I guess I'm the only one left in this floor. Those cowards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000911	It's a big mistake to look down on Corsairs in ground battles. {nl}As long as there is a place to set foot, we are unbeatable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000912	Eternity... Look at Tesla. {nl}You don't think that there is no agedness in eternal life, do you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000913	Don't compare me to the old folk who carve owls out of mere tree logs. {nl}I always use the best materials.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000915	I don't know about the frontlines but it makes no sense to complain to the Rearguard Unit. {nl}The Rearguards must work well for supplies to make it through.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000916	I can't even count how many monsters I had to fight on my way here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000917	Being in this battle for so long, I even wonder if there really was a goddess. {nl}I wonder if this is a dream, or whether we can wake up from it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000918	Even with the escort troops protecting us, I almost got myself killed twice.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000919	The supply troop is safer compared to other troops. {nl}But they do a lot more manual labor, so people avoid it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000920	The longer the battle goes on, the more soldiers are deserting. {nl}It's really frustrating.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000921	I understand that leaving the supplies and running away means failing the mission. {nl}But you need to be alive to deliver the supplies, don't you?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000924	There is another world beyond the world that you live in. {nl}You cannot cross both worlds unless you have supreme powers. {nl}At least, that was before the Divine Tree emerged. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000925	The aftermath of the disaster left a wound, opening cracks that divided these two worlds. {nl}And then, the demons freely crossed between worlds through the dimensional crack. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000926	The dimensional crack is scattered across many places. {nl}But the biggest problem would be the one in Demon Prison where the most dangerous demons are imprisoned.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000927	If the demons join the ones from Demon Prison through the dimensional crack.. {nl}It will be another threat to this world. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000928	I have told Vakarine to prepare for it. {nl}But the uncertainty brought by the torn demons might catch up with her. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000933	We need to stand up again. {nl}Your help gave me the strength to defeat the monster.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000938	About the second secret.{nl}Unfortunately, the demons of Naktis made their move first. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000941	I am studying how to release the curse of Naktis. {nl}Can you get me some monster samples for the poor people who are under the curse of monsters?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000942	It would have been nice if the Church sent us enough people. {nl}Oh, I better test the samples you brought.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000943	Oh no, that's a bland reaction. {nl}I'm sure each curse has it's own characteristic, but it seems like there's a key to it..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000944	I think I need to test again rather than just imagining it. {nl}I'm sorry but can you get me a different monster sample this time?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000945	I thought I just had to match the properties of the monster but it seems like the opposite. {nl}Naktis.. What could be moving that demon?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000946	Oh, I heard from Titas but I didn't think that's you. I feel reassured. {nl}Well then, please support the monster extermination mission.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000954	Did you find the herbs?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000955	Give me the herbs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000956	I need herbs to make the medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000957	Completed preparing medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000958	You need to get all of Maven's keys first. {nl}And you need to solve a lot of secrets to get the key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000959	Unfortunately, it is Maven's will that you solve every secret by yourself. {nl}First, get on the platform at the Meile Oratorium to solve the first secret and get the Holy Relic of Mercy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000960	Writing on the Platform
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000961	Remember the holy number with your two eyes. {nl}The light of candles drives away the evil dark.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000963	You must have seen the recruitment notice. {nl}It's true that we lack military manpower.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000964	The person in charge of the mission in Soul Peak is Julian. {nl}He will probably welcome you with open arms.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000965	That was great. You were of great help to this mission. {nl}What do you think about enlisting to the army?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000966	Can that thing even be broken? {nl}What the.. I'm at a loss for words to say. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000967	But you have to pay for damaging public facilities. {nl}Sorry but you have to fix the wooden seal.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000968	Thank you for saying that. {nl}I guess it is better to support Julian's troops in Soul Peak than here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000969	I'm planning to exterminate the monsters interfering the route to Gorge Area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000970	I heard the Pirent Wood in Jade Filled Cliff is solid and elastic. {nl}You can get ropes to tie those from the Red Panto Spearmans. Get me those first.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000972	Are you the one sent by Joseph of Klaipeda? {nl}Well even if you aren't, please help our village. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000973	We were fine even during Medzio Diena, but sometime ago, the bees suddenly turned into monsters. {nl}The other bee farms have already become a mess, and now I'm worried how our bee farm will fare.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000974	Our town lived on bee farming and mead. {nl}Goddess Austeja looks after us so we were better off than other villages.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000975	And then, on Medzio Diena, our once-normal bees suddenly turned into monsters. {nl}That and Goddess Austeja disappeared, with the priests telling us to wait for her return.. {nl}These days have been frustrating.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000976	Really?{nl} The other Revelators just ignored us... {nl}Ours is the Rododun Apiary just down the road. Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000977	I hope nothing happened. {nl}We put a lot of effort in the farm. We can't just lose it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000978	The bee farm is alright? What a relief. {nl}I got to think of a way to protect the bee farm now, quickly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000979	The monsters from other forests are also a problem in addition to the bees. {nl}I'm sure they are preying on honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000980	Oh, how about this? {nl}We'll fool the monsters with empty beehives. {nl}If there is no honey, why would the monsters bother attacking the apiary?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000981	When was it. I think it was around the same time the bees turned to monsters. {nl}A huge flock of monsters marched into our village. I've never seen that many monsters before. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000982	At first, they only gathered around Swaying Arable Land and Spring Light Woods. {nl}But it wasn't long before they moved onto here. {nl}I'm sure they are aiming for the honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000983	The monsters that smell sweet must have empty beehives. {nl}Goddess Austeja, we will need to borrow some of her help here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000984	You got one! {nl}I hope this will be enough to fool them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000985	By the way, I'm worried about the brewery of Mr. Dorjen. {nl}He must be fuming after seeing his life's work ruined by monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000986	I think he's been planning to burn the entire forest.. {nl}And he is not listening to us. Can you stop him?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000987	He spread out oil barrels near Micolas Brewery. You must get rid of those first. {nl}And about Mr. Dorjen.. Please help him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000988	Brewer Dorjen
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000989	What could the Revelator possibly want from me.. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000990	Hmm? Aren't these my cork stoppers? {nl}Did you just ruin my plan? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000991	Don't you dare think of stopping me. {nl}I am going to blow them up, even if it's going to cost me my brewery! {nl}..Can't even trust Revelators anymore now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000992	The monsters ruined the beefarm and brewery. {nl}So Joseph went to Klaipeda to look for Revelator who could help us. {nl}{NP}I thought the problem would be solved but guess what happened. {nl}They started disappearing one by one. They backed out. Those cowards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000993	Calm down? Do I look like I can calm down?! {nl}Okay. Maybe I can calm down if you get my signature mead from the Honey Wine Warehouse. {nl}That's if you can get it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000994	I bet you won't be able to get it. {nl}Just know that if you fail, I will burn down my workshop.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000995	What in the world.. did you actually get that? {nl}I thought you would give up because of the monsters... You are really remarkable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000996	Alright. You win. I won't burn down my workshop as I said. {nl}But I'm still pissed. All those years of work... because of those monsters..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000997	Thank you very much. {nl}I will feel much better if you do that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000998	I won't think about burning down the forest again. {nl}I'm sure a person with abilities like yours can save our village.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000999	That is enough. Whoa, Joseph did find great talent,{nl} even though we lost the apiary and brewery. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001000	I guess I can trust you unlike other Revelators. {nl}If it's alright, can you go to Maras in Three Brooks Wood?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001001	Kirina
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001002	I followed Darren here because I was worried for him, but what can I do now? {nl}There are so many monsters, I'm worried if I could even make it back.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001003	The monsters here all seem like they're possessed by something, it's scary. {nl}Now that I think about it, they all seemed to have our honey stuck on them...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001004	Thank you. Now how do I get back from here...{nl}Isn't it ironic, that the very bees that are beholden to us have now become monsters?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001005	Cleopas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001006	I can't take it anymore. Do you know Mikolas? {nl}Oh you wouldn't know. He's a guy I really adore. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001007	He started getting mad at me since some time ago and now he wouldn't even look at me. {nl}I have no clue why. I should know the reason at least to apologize or something.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001008	Oh, that is some sweet advice. {nl}He wouldn't get mad at someone he sees for the first time, would he?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001009	Why do you think he is mad? {nl}Can you guess why?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001010	Mikolas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001011	Oh Cleopas... What a shame on him to ask someone else's help. {nl}He borrowed my brewing machine, sold it somewhere, and now acts like he doesn't know about it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001012	How could he do that to me when I was so good to him? {nl}He even lied about it. He said he placed it in front of my workshop but I never received it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001013	Is Mikolas not ready yet?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001014	How could he do this to me?{nl}Mikolas...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001015	What? That doesn't make sense.{nl}I really left it at my brother's workplace.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001016	Ah, probably.. it may have been done by Elite Chukaruka.{nl}I saw it licking the brewing device. {nl}Can I ask one more time? What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001017	Thank you so much!{nl}I saw an Elite Chukaruka Dvikcoji Rest Area.{nl}If you find the brewing device by any chance, please let Mikolas know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001018	I hope the Elite Chukaruka took it.{nl}If not.. I don't wanna see his disappointed face.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001019	Oh, Isn't that my brewing device?{nl}Where did you get it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001020	Oh my god. I owe you a lot.{nl}And my Cleopas.. I can't lift up my face.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001021	I have a favor to ask you.{nl}Please obtain some royal jelly and hand it over to Cleopas.{nl}Cleopas really likes it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001022	Us?{nl}We are best friends who grew up in the same village.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001023	By the way, why are you asking?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001024	Ahah, thank you so much.{nl}You will be able to obtain royal jellies form the monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001025	If it weren't you, we would have never gotten closer again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001026	Um? Isn't this royal jellly?{nl}Mikolas... It is so fortunate. I was able to get rid of the misunderstanding because of you.{nl}May the Austeja bless you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001027	Maras
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001028	Was it you who Joseph was looking for? {nl}I don't care if you're not. {nl}If you don't help me, you will be the same as those Revelators who ran away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001029	After all, I've placed all of my faith in the priests, but I just can't it any longer.{nl}That's why I want to hire someone who is skillful like you. {nl}I will compensate you well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001030	I don't know what the priests are doing, because anyone would know that the monsters are after the honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001031	I made a request to Klaipeda, but they have not been responding since they lack the manpower.{nl}And it is not easy to hire mercenaries in this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001032	Thus, the only ones I can count on are the Revelators.{nl}You're looking for a goddess? We once had a goddess in our village.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001033	Look carefully for undamaged beehives.{nl}With luck, you might obtain some beehives that are in good condition.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001034	Oh, this one is quite big.{nl}Good job.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001035	Now, go to Vulvini Farm.{nl}If we could provide proof that the monsters are after the honey, the priests should stop only thinking about their altars.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001036	There are many altars around here.{nl}You know about them already, no? They were all created to praise Goddess Austeja.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001037	The disciples are only concentrating on the altars so they don't care whether we die in hunger or not.{nl}They think everything will be solved if they pray hard.{nl}That's why we decided to take an action.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001038	With a beehive that huge, you will definitely lure monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001039	How was it? How did they react?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001040	No response?{nl}Darn.. So they weren't just going after the honey.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001041	The monsters have been gathering near Bichiu Altar, so I figured they might be amassing honey there.{nl}But if they're not after the honey, maybe they're there for something else.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001042	You will find Bichiu Altar if you go down the road from here. {nl}If you see something suspicious, please bring it to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001043	You came back sooner than I expected.{nl}How was it? What did you see?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001044	So the monsters were going after this fragment?{nl}This is my first time seeing it... I should first check Gaudeji Altar up there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001045	If something suspicous comes out like a while ago, please hand it over to Lamar who is near the tree observatory tower.{nl}I really... don't know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001046	Lamar
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001047	Maras told you to show me this?{nl}This is the very object that the priest stressed to us not to touch, was it broken like this originally?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001048	I should talk to Maras about this.{nl}Something doesn't feel right... What could this be used for?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001049	Riesz
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001050	The monsters ruined all the fields so I was trying to start from scratch again.{nl}And then of all a sudden, a Honeypin showed up, so I left everything and ran away.{nl}My farming tools.. I don't know what to do now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001051	Thank you so much.{nl}The place where I lost it is Shirsie Sunny Place.{nl}The Honeypin is huge and scary, so don't overdo it if you can't handle it.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001056	Really? I am so touched.{nl}Ah, the beehives are at Saldus Bee Farm.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001065	That's why we lured the demons into demonic stones...{nl}Hasty behavior from the villagers created the trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001066	There is no way you can say you have nothing to do with this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001067	I don't know if Medzio Diena was the cause, but since some time ago,{nl}the evil energy began to dwell deep underground.{nl}The energy has accumulated so much, it could explode anytime now.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001082	Obviously, the goddess' powers can only indirectly affect demons. {nl}You will have to exhaust some of the demon's HP before using a branch on it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001083	Well done. {nl}It is uncomfortable to use the demons as sacrifice but... we're now reaching the final stage.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001084	Take this orb. I made it in a hurry, so it's not complete yet. {nl}You must fill it with magic at a place that is full of the goddess' holy energy.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001093	That would be so thankful. {nl}But you don't know how dangerous it could be so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001094	So could it be the evil forces that turned it to become so grotesque?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001110	Revelator. I assume you've heard the story from Goddess Austeja. {nl}That there are a number of Revelators who were addled by the evil energy attacking the village while trying to restore the seal here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001111	There is a way to save them. {nl}We can purify them if we find the symbol of Goddess Austeja.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001112	First regain the goddess' symbol and then use it to restore the Austeja Altar. {nl} Purifying the Revelators will come next.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001113	Whether it's to restore the weakened seal or to cure the addled Revelators, {nl}We will need that symbol.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001114	The damage is worse than at the seal in the shaking field. {nl}The evil forces are fuming out stronger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001115	Fortunately, the goddess blessed the villagers with her divine protection before focusing her effort on the seal... {nl}The Revelators from before had no way of knowing about this, their fates were sealed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001116	This is it, Revelator. {nl}This will save the addled Revelators.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001117	The addled Revelators will march towards here soon.{nl}Please purify them before anyone gets hurt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001118	Luckily, they did minimal damage. {nl}Now, if we can restore the seal, this will never have to repeat.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001119	Restore the weakened seal towers using the symbol of Goddess Austeja.{nl}There is the Rankis Seal and the Ranka Seal.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001120	The demons found out about the source of evil energy and so relentlessly attacked to destroy the seal. {nl}I'm sure if the seal is strengthened well this time, they will retreat after a while.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001121	We don't know what will happen next, though.{nl} We just have to believe that Goddess Austeja will take care of everything if anything happens.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001122	One thing that worries me is that... {nl}The symbol was destroyed once so it might not be fully restored again. {nl}Of course, everything will depend... on the goddess...{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001125	At a glance, you wouldn't be able to tell if they are a human or a monster. {nl}They would have a blank, soulless stare and when called, it would disappear while making a strange noise.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001145	Fortunately it does not seem damaged. {nl}If only I was stronger, I would have purified those monsters in the name of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001146	Some relics hide themselves when they feel an evil force. {nl}When that happens, you just can't find it no matter how hard you try.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001147	That's why I brought the beads that can detect holiness{nl}but look at those monsters' eyes. {nl}They might kill us as soon as we find the sacred things.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003396	Why did you come again?{nl}Did something come out from the sack?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003397	Jaunius

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003402	I remember that I hid many things one by one in the grass.{nl}Ah... I have a headache...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003403	What happened to the villagers...{nl}How come I was in this sack...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003404	Ah, thank you!{nl}That's it! You already found three of them!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003405	I was about to ask him something, but he just disappeared.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003407	I don't know who you are, but you came at the right time. The farmers here complain that their work is too hard.{nl}I am sharing this solution that I received from the baron to the farmers after diluting it.{nl}It's called Nutritious Tonic!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003408	{nl}I should get some poison of Scorpio to dilute this solution.{nl}It's simple. Just extract the poison right before it dies.{nl}After extracting the poison from it, it will be neutralized and die.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003409	As the baron ordered me, I am observing the farmers here,{nl}Actually, managing them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003410	Okay then, please get me the poison from it.{nl}This solution is too strong.{nl}And I also don't feel good about sharing it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003411	Do not repeatitively hit it even if it is unconcious.{nl}Just get closer to it slowly...{nl}Ah that's not it... just get close to it and talk to it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003412	Okay this is it.{nl}Just wait a minute.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003413	Now we should share this with the farmers here.{nl}Especially, Dalius over there. He looks as though he is out of his energy these days.{nl}He's not doing his job and looks down..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003414	You should take a leaf of sweet herb on your way.{nl}Even if you diluted it, it's too strong to be eaten alone.{nl}There are many sweet herbs around here so you won't have a trouble finding it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003415	I didn't miss anything.{nl}Please move fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003416	Dalius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003417	Who are you? and what's that?{nl}Stepas sent you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003418	He told me to take this?{nl}Nutritious tonic?{nl}I never expected this from him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003419	Ah, that...{nl}Maybe the medicine was too strong? or the poison of Scorpio got rotten.{nl}Well, don't think about it. You just continue on your way.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003420	Ah, my heard. What is this.{nl}I feel bloated...{nl}I shouldn't have eaten the food he gave to me!

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003424	Come back whenever it gets rotten.{nl}But, since there are not many of them, please take care.{nl}I only have six left.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003427	What are you doing? Move fast...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003428	Well.{nl}I don't understand why the food gets rotten whenever I cross there.{nl}... Is it because of the smoke there?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003429	{nl}How would I know about it. If you are going back to Marius, then get rid of those strange things.{nl}I can't do it because I am scared.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003430	They can be removed if I rub them with my feet and hands right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003431	I will eat this rice cake well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003432	In fact, I suspected the smoke.{nl}But as a farmer, I didn't know about it.{nl}I was also scared of those guys who claim that it was made by those barons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003433	Okay. Farewell.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003434	Baron Secretary Arunas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003435	Hello. I am the secretary of the baron, Areluno, who is the owner of this place.{nl}The baron ordered me to do something, but it's hard.{nl}I am little tired as well..I feel tired whenever I come out to the land.{nl}Please help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003436	Long time ago, this place was full of vitalities due to tennat farming, but since one day..{nl}Sorry, but I can't tell you anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003437	It's simple. Please investigate that place a bit, and make sure the crops are growing well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003438	Is the task that I requested to you not done yet?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003439	Ah, is that so. They are really like that as the baron and Rimas told so.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003440	Then, we should remove that energy.{nl}I will give you some woods first so please make the magic circle using that woods on that place.{nl}Like me, you don't seem to have skill to create a magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003441	{nl}I will give you this spell scroll. First make it by tieing it with woods and burn it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003442	I am counting on you.{nl}I think feel more tired due to the energy in this place..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003443	Ah, I am tired..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003444	Yes? The crops died?{nl}Was the spell too strong?{nl}Well, don't think about that too much. If you were able to remove the strage energy, it would be fine.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003446	Are you the Revelator?{nl}Please do not think about the machine behind me.{nl}Unless you help me with one of my tasks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003447	This machine is being used for an important task.{nl}It is related to the past that isn't that long ago.{nl}The portal that would bring the eternal life and the power that sustains the eternal life..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003448	You can only minimize the strange energy surrounding this place by enhancing the seal magic circle.{nl}To do so, we need those empty bottles.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003449	Is everything going alright?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003450	Very nice.{nl}The machine is going well for sure.{nl}Its all because of you.{nl}And that strange energy is influencing the growth of the crops here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003451	I activate the power generator using the fuel that we accumulated in that storage.{nl}That's why we needed more grains.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003452	{nl}It is so fortunate that the farmers are helping us without resistance.{nl}..Anyways, recently that storage is being attacked by the monsters so we worry about it.{nl}I guess its not strange since the grains are piled up there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003453	I can only say that the power generator helps to keep the gate open which leads to an important place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003454	I don't know when those monsters appear again so I can't leave this place. I can't also let the baron do it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003455	It will be quite for some time. {nl} Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003456	The storage door is locked.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003458	What is that? Is that the head of the stone statue? Give it to me. I got something to check.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003459	It is the upper body of something. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003460	Is that the lower body of the stone statue..?{nl}Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003461	That looks like a wing.. Can you give it to me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003462	I have a headache..{nl}Why am I here..?{nl}Anyways, I will return.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003463	Should I take some rest..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003465	Really? A person comes out from the sack?{nl}Why did he do that?{nl}Well. I don't know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003466	The baron, Areluno is the landlord of this land!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003467	Sergeant Stepas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003468	The farmers here are too lazy. {nl}If I was the landlord, I would have swept them all..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003469	{nl}The baron is very kind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003470	Even if this place belongs to the baron, this place is too infertile and the monsters also took the seeds..{nl}So, can you retrieve the seeds that were taken by the monsters?{nl}I put them well in my pocket..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003471	I need more seeds.. Can you get me some more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003472	I don't know who took it. We should catch them all.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003473	I don't know anymore.{nl}If he could share me a small plot of field, that would be good.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003474	Yes. That's right. Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003475	Now we have some seeds. Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003476	Ah, that's right.{nl}There are many ways to enhance the magic circle.{nl}It is always a problem that I can't go since I can't leave the baron and this magic power generator behind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003477	{nl}Okay. Take these and scatter them.{nl}This is one of the methods for the enhancement. I made it to prepare times like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003478	Use the poison to enhance the magic circle?..{nl}I am not sure if its right, but let's try it anyways.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003479	I've collected that poison from the monsters.{nl}The monsters are very vicious and hard.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003480	Benius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003481	There are Manticens which the baron takes care at the Mirukis farm.{nl}I was little bit worried that they only do what they want to do..{nl}Anyways, yesterday, I fed them. Little big one.{nl}Their habit is to eat something after hiding somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003482	{nl}I will search here so could you please take a look at Vinai brewery?{nl}I will give you a lump of meat so use it as a bait.{nl}They always hide like that so I can't feed them on the right time.{nl}I wouldn't worry if there were only one or two of them..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003483	Protect the things that are important to the baron?{nl}Hahat!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003484	Ha, Where did they go..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003485	Even if we miss one, no one would recognize.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003486	Horacius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003487	Revelator?{nl}We don't have enough workforce at the moment so could you please help us?{nl}We need to prepare many things to do a big task.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003488	I don't know why, but, somehow I am the one who is leading.{nl}Its embarrassing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003489	Please get some wood sticks from the tree fence near here.{nl}I will make a round woodstick.{nl}Let's say.. it is some kind of tool.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003490	Recycle the trees that were used in the fence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003491	Very well indeed!{nl}With this much, I think we have enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003492	I even have a plan to put the stone in the middle of a leather string.{nl}More we have, we will be better off.{nl}I am sorry to you..{nl}In fact, we should take care of our job, but we are in a hurry.. I am sorry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003493	You should be busy with the task of revelation...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003494	{nl}Well, I will explain it to you.{nl}To get a revenge on the source of the destruction and to find out the truth behind the everything that is happening here.{nl}Our objectives are those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003495	The monsters have something that looks like a hard core.{nl}That is harder than a stone so if one gets hit by that, its quite lethal.{nl}And I think it would be better to get those from the monsters instead of getting stones here where the stones are not hard enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003496	We will take care of our own tasks
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003497	That's enough.{nl}Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003498	We should accumulate the poison that we will put on the weapons.{nl}The battles will be effective as a result.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003499	Our biggest weakness is that it's not certain.{nl}It seems that they are hiding something in the restricted area in the aqueduct bridge.{nl}He is a greedy oldman, so there must be something inside. I am sure of it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003500	Place the poisonous pots and lure the monsters near them.{nl}When you collect enough, please bring me those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003501	I am sorry that I had to make you do this kind of work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003502	Farming tools are used to plowing the fields so they can be also used in battles.{nl}But we would definitely need the help from the farmers..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003503	Show the letter that I gave to you and if you successfully persuade them, you would be able to receive their farming tools.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003504	I hope the farmers don't request something big..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003505	You broought a lot!{nl}Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003506	Tauras
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003507	You fight well when you are not in hunger.{nl}I am called Tauras and I am in charge of supplying the food.{nl}We don't have enough time so we need help from anyone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003508	{nl}Could.. you help me a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003509	Desire comes when you are not in hunger.{nl}You may think there's plenty of food since this place is farming area..{nl}But that's before the plundering took place.{nl}Farming is hard and I am always in hunger..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003510	{nl}It is reasonable that we should prepare something like this.{nl}We will make it happen with Horacius.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003511	Please get some dandelions there.{nl}Dandelions are thankful flowers.{nl}They can be used with grains to make soups and they can also be used in medicines.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003512	We appreciate for your help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003513	Thanks. I feel so relieved.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003514	Dried food is better to keep it for a long time.{nl}Especially, you will feel full when you consume only a little amount of beef jerky.{nl}That's why we are accumulating them a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003515	Since one day, lots of plunderings occurred in this place.{nl}The farmers starved to death..But one thing strange is that although some of them didn't die due to hunger, we kept hearing the reports about their disappearances.{nl}I personally think this has something to do with the baron.{nl}I want to find out about that. Even if I would have to use my force.{nl}Horacius was the one who agreed with my plan.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003516	Obtain some meats from the monsters in this region and put them in the dryer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003517	The key to this plan is whether we would be able to get fresh meats from the monsters.{nl}They hardly give up..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003518	Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003519	The problem is that the food storage gets attacked by the monsters frequently.{nl}Please help me a bit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003520	The food storage should be somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003521	I can relax for now, but I don't know when they would attack again..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003522	Albina
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003523	Are you the Revelator?{nl}I listen to the stories even when I am here in this rural region.{nl}I am planning to restore the Tenants' Farm here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003524	{nl}It is crucial to avoid the eyes of the baron.{nl}It is my mission to eliminate the vicious marks that were put in various places.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003525	I've been doing this job for a long time..{nl}And we have only 3 left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003526	Over the fence, there is an altar that the villagers used to do ritual ceremonies.{nl}But due to the strong monster that the baron left here, we can't do ritual ceremonies anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003527	I can only guess.{nl}I am sure that something serious is going on here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003528	Be careful.{nl}It is very vicious.{nl}I am keep trying, but I always failed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003529	Oh my god!{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003530	The seal magic circle which was discoverd in the A area... We should eliminate it.{nl}This is the hard stone that we obtained from the monsters.{nl}If we throw this, we may able to break the field.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003531	I am the one who should have finished this job..{nl}I am sorry that I passed this job to you...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003532	Cheer up, Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003533	Ohoh, you succeeded!{nl}Now this place is going back to its normal status.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003534	There's a magic circle in this region as well.{nl}We should break that.{nl}But, the monsters are always disturbing us...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003535	Just think that the monsters don't have brains.{nl}They are not on the baron side and they are also not on our side.{nl}They always cause troubles and they disturb our tasks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003536	I feel so relieved to see that you are so enthusiastic.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003537	We are almost there! The moment of restoration!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003538	There are lots of tasks to do for the restoration.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003539	The pieces that you gave to me are not normal.{nl}These must be.. those barons must have manipulated something on this land and destructed them.{nl}You collected all these...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003540	{nl}Can I trust you?{nl}Hmm, then...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003541	I am collecting the clues here.{nl}I can't tell you in details, but I am preparing something big.{nl}We should have some reasons to persuade the farmers and the villagers to do that task.{nl}I am collecting those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003542	First, I should glue these pieces together. Can you get me some sticky fluid from the monsters?{nl}I will try to glue them with it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003543	{nl}I feel... I feel like ruining the divinity, but I have no choice since I am running out of the supplies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003544	We don't have enough sticky fluid.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003545	Okay that would be enough. Give it to me.{nl}I will try to glue them together.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003546	To prepare the big task that we will do in the near future, I am collecting the clues to persuade the farmers.{nl}I mean... since the baron is wrong, I am telling you to get a revenge on the plunderings and the cruelties.{nl}.. I will tell you that much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003547	I mean, we should take the monster to the magic circle down there.{nl}In order to succeed the experiment, it would be better to extract the half of the blood from it.{nl}And then make it react to the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003548	You are understanding correctly right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003549	Yes.{nl}It really was like that. Monsters fall into the eternal sleep.. dying..{nl}The monsters are dying due to the energy coming from there...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003551	From the one day, the crops here do not grow anymore.{nl}Even after I scatter the seeds a lot.{nl}So I am thinking maybe the reason of it is related to the magic circle that was created by the fellows of the baron.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003552	As you can see, this place is full of water.{nl}The place full of water means that this land is very fertile.{nl}But, you can see it right? The crops at some places are not growing.{nl}It's not that all the fields are like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003553	When you see the place near the magic circle, you will see the monsters with flames on them.{nl}Long time ago, I was able to put the flames on some of them in order to eliminate the magic circle, but after that I was so busy here.{nl}When you go there and put them into the magic circle, the field will break.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003554	Still not completed?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003555	Wow amazing.{nl}Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003556	But, the magic circles are still left.{nl}Is there some way we could borrow the mighty power of the goddesses...{nl}Only if there were the statues of the goddesses...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003557	Starting from the one day, those barons' plunderings increased a lot and many magic circles were created a lot. Somehow, some of them were less shiny.{nl}Anyways, when you get near the bright ones, it will be hard to eliminate them since you may get hurt.{nl}Of course, the most difficult task is to avoid the eyes of the barons and continue to do this task.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003558	{nl}I don't know exactly who you are, but you are the perfect candidate to help us since you are not well known here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003559	Yoana has it?{nl}If we put them in the magic circle, don't you think the field would break?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003560	You came well at the right time. I tied them up with the sticky fluid.{nl}... As I expected. This is the statue of the goddess.{nl}You tied them up with the fluid from the monsters... I am so sorry...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003561	{nl}You need this? Take it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003562	I am counting on you.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003566	Master, have you seen my seed pocket that the monsters took away from me?{nl}I am begging you.. please find the seed pocket for me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003567	It's lacking.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003568	Ah, thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003569	There is an unstable sealed magic circle down there. {nl}The baron told me that the seal which prevents the strange energy spurting out from the places nearby is not perfect yet so the energy is leaking out. However, the problem is that it doesn't look like that.{nl}It is suspicious.{nl}Now we have to tie up these pieces, so can you find more about the energy on behalf of me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003570	Hmm.. It is almost completed now.{nl}We have enough reasons.. the food, almost everything.{nl}Now, we just have one more to go...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003571	My wish is not something big. We just want to live.{nl}Harvest for one year and stay full until the next harvest. {nl}We, farmers want only that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003572	{nl}If that one thing doesn't get accomplished, we have no choice, but to stand up.{nl}Against the source of the plunderings.{nl}Also if the process of the plunderings ruin the mighty power of the goddess, and the objective of the plunderings results from the greed of one person, we do have to get mad about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003573	We do have to check whether the farmers would particpate.{nl}I will give you the sheet so please get their signatures on the sheet.{nl}Along with the date for the execution, this sheet confirms that we all act together for the same purpose.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003574	{nl}How could I request this to you...{nl}I am so sorry. If this gets completed, we will do the rest ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003575	This task will give you some trouble.{nl}The farmers are not that simple.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003576	Completed!{nl}Now you go on your way!{nl}I can't leave the completion of the task to you. That's too much burden for you.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003577	To do a big task..{nl}We should accumulate some clues.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003578	Ah, What should I do...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003579	Leader Horacius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003580	More we prepare, better off we are.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003581	Now, leave the things to us here.{nl}Thank you so much for everything so far.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003582	I mean the second secret. {nl}Unfortunately, it seems that Naktis' servants have taken the lead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003583	I am investigating on how to undo Naktis' curse here.{nl}For the sake of those who are suffering from the curse, can you get me samples of the demons?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003584	Well darn. We should be experimenting, not imagining things.{nl}I am sorry, but could you get me samples of other demons?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003585	How come the goddesses leave those filthy demons like that...{nl}Is this also what the goddesses want?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003586	We should just finish it before it gets in the hands of Naktis.{nl}Defeat the demons and find the divine artifacts of the salvation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003587	We don't have much time left to stay in the Great Cathedral.{nl}In the meantime, we should find clues on how to release the curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003588	We should find out how Naktis' curse influences the psychology of humans...{nl}It really is a tough nut to crack.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003589	The Great Cathedral is like a repository of knowledge.{nl}If you find those documents, we will easily find a way how to face against Naktis.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003590	If no one maintains it, even great architectural wonders collapse easily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003591	I knew that the Great Cathedral would still be standing, even on Medzio Diena.{nl}But, Naktis' attacks were not something that could be endured.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003592	4 years have passed since the congregation ordered the evacuation...{nl}Everything about the Great Cathedral is meaningless now due to Naktis' curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003593	Priest Ruodell
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003594	Hmm, I know it is an order from the congregation, but we should first retrieve the Great Cathedral...{nl}Then we would be able to get an answer for the curse as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003595	I don't know if we will be able to find a way to release the curse if things continue like this.{nl}If I only had the power, I would have driven all demons out from the Great Cathedral.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003596	Priest Yosana
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003597	The congregation told us that they will retake the Great Cathedral once Naktis' curse is resolved.{nl}It just isn't right to leave the Great Cathedral, which supported the goddesses, like this for four years.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003598	We lost many documents in the Great Cathedral due to Naktis' servants.{nl}Whenever I think about it, I feel so bad that we lost them..{nl}Those documents were over a hundred years old...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003602	Thank you so much!{nl}I need them as fresh and green as possible.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003610	So the true nature of the curse was Chapparition.{nl}I was busy with the curse of Naktis so I think its so fortunate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003611	Ah, can you send this report to Priest Aden if you get a chance to go back to the Main Chamber?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003612	The revelation is being protected by the five keys of Maven.{nl}To get those keys, you must solve all the secrets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003613	Then I should go back to your small pocket for a minute.{nl}Do not trust anyone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003614	The goddess wants you and Hauberk to defeat the pawns of Blut so that the 1st zone gets released from the control of the demons.{nl}To do so, you should disturb the consciousness of the subordinates who try to free the Blut.{nl}Could you defeat the monsters at the gathering place of Rituala?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003616	They tried to break the loosened barriers and run away outside.{nl}Get some help from Hauberks if you can.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003617	Well done. I feel that the barriers in this region are more enhanced now.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003621	Unlike the other guys, I can't possess your body.{nl}So please carry my pieces of the seal now and enter inside.{nl}I will guide you from there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003622	Blut are facing against Kupole Zydrone at Nuzikalti Hall.{nl}Zydrone would try his best to resist, but I can't keep them anymore with our power only.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003623	The only way to weaken Blut is to get the secreting glands that Blut shared with his subordinates and weaken his influence.{nl}There are Blut's guys near Bjaurer Hideout. Get the secreting glands of Blut from them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003624	The goddess is facing against the Demon Lord somewhere in the prison.{nl}She desperately needs help from you and Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003625	Good. I will eliminate this from this world.{nl}Blut would feel like as if he lost it's feelers.{nl}It will be a big help to Zydrone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003626	The battle with Blut will be hard for us.{nl}Hauberk should help us. We should grant the substance to Hauberk again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003627	{nl}Blut sealed his power at his altar for his escape.{nl}If Hauberk could absorb that, it will be a great help to us.{nl}Go to the concentrated area. Control the altar there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003628	{nl}If you succeed on granting substance to Hauberk, please go see Zydrone.{nl}We are really running out of time now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003629	The power of the demons reject the power of the goddesses. Only Hauberk can do this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003630	Were you able to grant the substance to Hauberk? It is so fortunate.{nl}Everything will go as the goddess wishes...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003631	I locked Blut in the barrier of the prison, but it won't stand long.{nl}When we are prepared, we should defeat it with Hauberk.{nl}If we lose, Vakarine would also fall down.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003632	Go to the 2nd area of the prison. Norgaile is waitng for you and Hauberk there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003633	Blut and his followers want to escape to the external world. Can you defeat them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003634	The power of the Goddesses should control here again...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003635	Well done. Now I am relieved.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003636	The investigation team formed by humans came here lately.{nl}However, they could not get out and died here.{nl}The demons carry their belongings like their booties.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003637	{nl}If you could retrieve them, I will hand them over to their families when this place becomes stabilized.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003639	Thanks. I hope there are no more sacrifices like this...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003641	{nl}In order to destroy the power of Nuaele here, we should eliminate his subordinates.{nl}At the 1st isolated zone, there's some guy who is waiting for Nuaele to defeat Kupole Aldona.{nl}Please defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003642	I am worried about Aldona at Nuaele's place...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003643	Even if we fail to defeat Nuaele, we reduced the number of his followers who would listen to his orders so I think it would be safe for some time..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003644	All demons here were the followers of Hauberk at this place.{nl}Hauberk knows well about that. {nl}Hauberk was granted with the substance, but I am sure he is still unstable.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003648	Before Hauberk's seal pieces return to Hauberk, I expect the demons would be in confusion for a while.{nl}Hauberk must regain his power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003649	Nuaele had many chances to use the accumulated power to go out into the world by breaking into the weakened power of the Goddesses.{nl}But, he is waiting something. We don't know what he is waiting for.{nl}We should interrogate the subordinates of Nuaele to find out what that is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003650	{nl}I will give you this marble that I received from the Goddesses.{nl}Kupoles can't use this anymore since the control of the Goddesses in the prison became weak.{nl}But since Hauberk helps you, you will be able to read the minds of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003651	When the power of the goddesses get weak, the power of us, Kupoles also get weak.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003652	They were thinking of making the demon prison into their demon realm from the first place.{nl}If this place falls into the hands of him, even Ausrine won't be able to do anything.{nl}You just told me an important information. Thank you.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003654	Hauberk would welcome this. We don't need that kind of subordinates anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003655	When Hauberk was sealed by Helgasercle, the demons thought that no one like Hauberk would appear again.{nl}But, Nuaele is acting like Hauberk and he became the most threatening Demon Lord.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003662	I will pass these necklaces to Vakarine when this place gets okay.{nl}I hope the goddesses always protect you...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003667	{nl}I will restore my Dionys to its previous status now.{nl}Meet Zydrone. Please help her to complete my key.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003670	Dionys was family of the goddess and her companion.{nl}The goddess became very sad after sacrificing Dionys to seal him up with the chains.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003671	We can start the ritual again. When the Evening Star Key gets completed, we would be able to restore Dionys who became violent to her normal status.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003672	Let's go to Oruarma Cathedral. As I am recharging this key, you should protect me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003673	{nl}Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003674	Please bring this key to Aldona.{nl}On behalf of the tired goddesses, Aldona is preventing the escape of Dionys.{nl}Please hurry.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003676	Please unseal the Rearda, Kasa and Rada Seals that are near the magic suppressor using the Evening Star Key that you received from Zydrone.{nl}You will have easier time facing against Dionys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003677	The goddess prepared for the everything that could occur.{nl}The problem is time. If we arrive late, then even Vakarine won't be able to do anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003678	As the seal unleashes, the lights of the goddess are coming to the magic suppressor.{nl}Now, everything is ready. We also have enough time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003679	I will persuade Dionys first, but it won't be effective.{nl}Dionys has the chains that Giltine had created.{nl}That's why she is breaking everything she sees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003680	If we fail, Dionys will escape from this place.{nl}It will be the same thing as unleashing tens of Demon Lords to this world.{nl}Tell me when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003681	We just ran into a problem. The reason why the goddess helped Hauberk to regain his energy was because Hauberk is the key who can quiet down this mess.{nl}The goddess tried to close the space that was opened from the demon realm using the chains and the spirits of Hauberk.

Before he ran away like that, I had to lock him up...{nl}{nl}I am so sorry to see the goddess again.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003834	Sir Uska would have scolded me if it weren't for you... Thank you so much.{nl}Anyways, I wonder why the soldiers haven't returned yet?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003835	Ah, this is troubling.{nl}I heard the monsters here are supposed to be innocuous, but they suddenly turned violent.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003836	What the hell is the world coming to?{nl}...Now Alan, my colleague, is left protecting the entrance gate to the farm all by himself.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003837	Can you really do that?{nl}Alright, please take care of Alan before the other soldiers return.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003838	Soldier Alan
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003839	Don't come! Monsters are coming!{nl}Damn it, how will I be able to stand against this alone..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003840	It's so fortunate that you are here.{nl}How come I can't hear anything from the soldiers who went to defeat Gorgon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003841	Was Alan okay?{nl}It's so fortunate that you're here, otherwise the whole district would've been swept away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003842	So you are the Revelator that I've heard rumors of. Thank you so much.{nl}I don't know why those monsters turned out like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003843	Louise
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003844	I received the farm land from Gytis, but it's such a mess.{nl}Especially Ridimed. But, what can I do with my hands that only touched hoes before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003845	Just as I ran into trouble, I'm so lucky to have met the goddesses' helper.{nl}I am counting on you. It's already too late to manage the crops though.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003846	You really drove the annoying Ridimeds away?{nl}That's such good news.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003847	It's so good to hear that you drove the Ridimeds away.{nl}Now let's see what we can do next.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003848	I think it would be helpful if I at least had a fence.{nl}Can you help me a little more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003849	There's a lot of wood from the trees that have been cut down at the cultivation area.{nl}If you could bring me some, we could make a fence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003850	Among the farms that were damaged on Medzio Diena, there are many that can't be recovered at the moment.{nl}They are either corrupted by evil energies or have too many monsters in them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003851	So Uska planned to make farmland by cultivating this forest.{nl}The restoration is important right now, but we can't do anything if we can't even obtain food supplies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003852	If the monsters were harmless, I would have done it myself.{nl}Heck, we wouldn't have to make the fence in the first place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003853	Fortunately the wood isn't corrupted.{nl}Please wait a bit. I will make the fence quickly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003854	That scarecrow should scare the monsters, but it's too small.{nl}We should make the scarecrow look bigger. Using the monsters' fluffy hair might do the trick.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003855	The scarecrow should be bigger than humans.{nl}I will make the scarecrow bigger using the hair of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003856	Good. Now we are ready to set the fence.{nl}There are still a lot of monsters, so I hope you can help me to do this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003857	I was worried about the monsters, but now I am also worried about not having enough crops.{nl}Strangely, they don't grow anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003858	I really appreciate you making the fence.{nl}It will help the citizens of Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003859	Researcher Gareth
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003860	The crops are growing too slowly.{nl}If we don't solve this, we may miss the harvest season.. Could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003861	As Uska ordered, Gytis is leading the construction.{nl}Instead of attempting to restore the farms that were corrupted on Medzio Diena, they want to cultivate the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003862	Originally, the farmland belonged to the city, so the owner of the farm never came.{nl}But due to the food problem, they made the farm entirely in the name of the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003863	First, could you get me samples of the Sakmolis?{nl}That monster is a plant-type, so it must have been influenced just like the crops were.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003864	This is our last chance.{nl}If we don't find out why the crops grow so slowly, we may have to give up on this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003865	So you've got them.{nl}Please wait a bit. I'll get the results soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003866	So the monster suppressor was the problem.{nl}We were trying to prevent the number of monsters from increasing, but we almost ruined the crops as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003867	First, please retrieve the Monster Suppressor.{nl}If we had a weaker device we would switch to it, but we can't do anything about that right now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003868	These were made for plant-type monsters so they would definitely influence the crops too.{nl}It was my fault for overlooking that possibility.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003869	If it weren't for you, the harvest could've been spoiled and all that effort would've been wasted.{nl}Everything should grow well now, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003870	They're late. My colleagues went to the Ishigiti Herb Farm to defeat the Gorgon.{nl}I don't wanna think that they were annihilated.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003871	Soldier Peirce
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003872	Run! Gorgon is coming!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003873	I hope I'm wrong.{nl}The monsters are going crazy...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003874	You defeated the Gorgon yourself?{nl}It is fortunate that my colleagues are safe, but I don't know what they did as soldiers..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003875	I will report to Sir Uska that you saved this farm.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003876	Help me! The Gorgon is chasing after us!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003877	The person who is leading the mission at Dvasia Peak is Julian.{nl}Julian will really welcome me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003878	Thanks for your words.{nl}But it would be better to support Julian's squad at Dvasia Peak instead of this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003879	I heard that the hardness and the elasticity of the wood sticks of Firent at Nepritas Cliffs is good.{nl}You can get the rope that was made from tieing those sticks from Red Pantos with spears. Please get me those first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003880	At first, they were gathered to Uskis Arable Land and Spring Light Wood.{nl}But, not after a long time, they came to this place.{nl}They must be going after the honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003881	You're the most trustworthy Revelator I've ever met.{nl}If it's okay with you, could you look for a person named Maras at Vilna Forest up north?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003882	If you find something like this again, please hand it over to Lamar near the Wood Watch Tower.{nl}I.. really don't know anything about those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003883	You've gathered a lot.{nl}I think this will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003884	Since the seal towers here were damaged more seriously than the one at Uskis Arable Land,{nl}the evil energy here flows stronger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003885	There is one thing I am worried about..{nl}That symbol was once damaged so it may not restore the seal perfectly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003886	I believe that the goddesses will protect us.{nl}But, we must also do our best to repair the seal.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003887	I heard about the thorny forest before.{nl}That place was once a normal forest, right? What do we do if our village turns out like that?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003888	I can't just endure the monsters' violence anymore.{nl}We have to protect the village from now on instead of only relying on the priests.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003889	This isn't all happening because Goddess Austeja is absent, right?{nl}If it's true though, what should I do now?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003890	I will give you this scroll of purification, use this on the demons and then defeat them.{nl}The demons' fluids will become a solvent purified with the holy energy of the Great Cathedral.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003891	You were able to avoid the curse, but you could not get away from the monsters.{nl}Maybe it was wrong to come here to do the pilgrimage.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003892	You will pay for your intent of obtaining the revelation.{nl}Of course, you should obtain the fourth key of Maven as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003893	Finally, the last key.{nl}I've been waiting for this moment for hundreds of years..{nl}A sentiment that is neither joy nor emptiness fills my heart.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003894	The last secret is in the Small Reception Room.{nl}You should remember the order of the candles and their number.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003895	Maven's Message
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003896	I am glad that my life's masterpiece has protected the revelation well.{nl}But, yours and my mission is not over yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003897	Savior. Please open the door to Pasala Altar.{nl}If you really wish to obtain the revelation of the goddess, you will receive it at the end...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003898	My guidance ends here.{nl}It has been very fortunate that I was able to guide you well...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003899	I am going back to the goddesses.{nl}Please... save the kingdom and the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003900	Let's extract the curse's energy from the Penitence Route and make it appear.{nl}While I am concentrating, please activate all the Altars of Purification.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003901	The curse of Naktis makes people suffer just by looking at it.{nl}It makes people miserable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003902	We have no other choice, but to find the solutions for each curse.{nl}It's like there are different treatments to different diseases.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003903	I want to go back to my hometown.{nl}Demons, the curse... I am tired of everything now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003904	When the next priest comes, I am planning to return to my hometown with them.{nl}It will be really good if I could return home while I am alive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003905	Naktis' curse isn't the only one in this world.{nl}The famous city of Roxona is still effectively under the curse of petrification even though hundreds of years has passed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003906	The documents that are normal must still be present in the deeper side of the Great Cathedral...{nl}I am so sad that I wasn't able to see those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003907	I would say that was the wisdom of Maven.{nl}Maven thought that the Great Cathedral would not be normal all the time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003908	So if we could just recharge the magical power, any kinds of magics will be okay.{nl}Even if that's a magical power from the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003909	Go to Karuna Altar when you've recharged the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power.{nl}The third key is waiting for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003910	If you think you are ready, I will show you the true nature of the curse.{nl}If you can't eliminate it at once, it will make a bigger trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003911	Now all that's left is the Verification Test.{nl}The scripture that possesses my spirit, please open it in front of the altar of the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003912	The Scriptural Relics contained the words of the great bishops...{nl}I am so infuriated that they are placed now in the wake of filthy demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003913	Fortunately, most of the holy relics seem okay.{nl}If I had a little more power, I would have purified the demons in the name of the goddesses right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003914	To prepare for times like this, I've brought an orb that can detect holy energy.{nl}Keep an eye on the demons though. You may be in for some trouble,{nl}since they will run towards the relics as soon as they see them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003915	We were sent from the congregation to investigate Naktis' curse.{nl}We should first find the documents that were scattered here, but those demons are a problem.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003916	The lost documents all contain important content.{nl}I want to bring all of them, but we should first remove the curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003917	This is a big help.{nl}When I treat the people who are cursed, I will tell them your name.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003918	I made a stupid mistake.{nl}I lost my concentration for a moment and lost the report that I should've sent to Aden.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003919	I have been looking around, but I think the demons may have played a part in this.{nl}If it's alright with you, could you help me look for the report?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003920	Ah! This is it.{nl}If you get a chance to go to the Main Chamber, please hand it over to Aden.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003921	We will need a lot of solvent in order to make the reagent that removes Naktis' curse.{nl}But, as you can see, we can't get the solvent at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003922	But, there is still a way.{nl}If you could help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003923	I was confident in making reagents so I thought I would be successful.{nl}I think I overestimated myself.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003924	Thanks.{nl}The purity is a little lacking... but, if we refine it one more time, it will be useful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003925	You are late. Maven's secret here is already being attacked.{nl}If we lose the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power, we will never be able to get the third key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003926	I regret that I could not do anything.{nl}We should get the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003927	It is very fortunate that the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power is alright. {nl}However, I can't seem to sense its magical power anymore, likely due to the long passage of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003928	Defeat the demons nearby using the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power.{nl}This will collect the magical power that is needed to obtain the third key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003929	To remove Naktis' curse, I am making a reagent which resists against evil energy. {nl}But, it's hard to guarantee its effects right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003930	If you are okay, can you check the effects of the medicine?{nl}Ah, I don't mean to try it yourself. I am telling you to try on the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003931	This reagent pulls out evil energy from the body.{nl}But, it could cause internal injuries.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003932	It's either ineffective or... actually it seems okay.{nl}It even explodes?{nl}Then we should work on it little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003933	The number of Maven's keys that remain now are two.{nl}The secret for one of those keys cannot be solved right now, with the condition of the Cathedral as it is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003934	We have only one method... using the demons.{nl}I will tell you about the plan later, there are some things to find first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003935	There are documents here that describe a method of disguising as a demon in this Sanctuary.{nl} Through this method, you should be able to get the next key without shedding a drop of blood.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003936	You found it. Now let me see.{nl}Where was the clause..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003937	Ah. The method is rather simple. But you may have to put in some effort.{nl}First, get some articles of clothing from Naktis' servants.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003938	Using the demons... The goddesses may turn their heads away,{nl}but if this is the best method, I will do it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003939	That will be enough.{nl}Now use the apparel to complete the scroll.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003940	In this recipe, it says that you can complete the Demon Transformation Scroll at the Altar of Intelligence.{nl}Fortunately, the Altar of Intelligence is at Laukimas Antenave.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003941	That's the passion of the priests who tried to protect the kingdom from the forces of evil. {nl}It continued on for hundreds of years until today.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003942	So the demons went to Apgaule Altar without any complaints?{nl}Now then, it is time we follow them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003943	I am making the medicine quickly to heal one of the pilgrims who is cursed.{nl}I am almost finished, but it's so hard to get the thistle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003944	By itself, the medicine tries to push out the evil energy, so he won't consume it easily.{nl}I am thinking about putting the medicine in meat. Could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003945	I hope this method is effective.{nl}It will save a lot of people.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003946	The smell is strong enough so you should be able to deceive him.{nl}Please wait a minute. I will put the medicine into the meat.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003947	Any meat will be okay. Even the meat from the monsters nearby.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003948	It's completed.{nl}The medicine should work well.. Can you pass this meat to the pilgrim down there?{nl}{nl}You should continue to feed him until he is satisfied.{nl}I mean all the meats you've obtained. 20 lumps in total right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003949	So the pilgrim ate the meat?{nl}Ah... still not well yet?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003950	So the medicine worked well?{nl}Really... that is so fortunate. Thanks for helping me.{nl}I will tell the other priests about this recipe.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003951	I can sense another kind of curse. This curse is different from Naktis' curse.{nl}The true origin of it should be present somewhere, but it's hard for me to find it alone.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003952	We've found it!{nl}Now we will eliminate the true origin.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003953	My friend looks strange. {nl}He is not breathing and his face looks pale. His heart also doesn't beat anymore.{nl}Did he already leave for the goddesses? Dallas, please open your eyes..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003954	Thank you so much. {nl}Dallas would also speak of you to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003955	I am going to go to bury Dallas.{nl}Can you be with me until the end?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003956	So you are safe.{nl}I am going to go back to my hometown with Dallas' belongings.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003957	Are the peaceful days going to return like the old times?{nl}Revelator...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003958	Revelator. I want to bury Dallas under the Taika Cliff where he can see his hometown.{nl}But there are so many monsters there. Please get rid of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003959	First, it would be better to find some documents at the Sanctuary.{nl}I remember there are documents there about methods of disguising as demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003960	Okay. Use the scroll to lure the demons to the Apgaule Altar.{nl}If you want to know what will happen... Well, you'll have to wait and see.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003961	There is a dangerous demon luring priests and leading them to their deaths.{nl}It disguises itself to look like a secret of Maven.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003962	The location is Maskuote Narthex.{nl}Please relieve our priests of this threat so they can concentrate on their mission.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003963	I will submit a report as soon as I return to the congregation.{nl}This should soothe the priests who were in despair. Thanks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003964	And so all five keys are now collected.{nl}Go to Pasala Altar. The secret there will lead you to the hidden room.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003965	Are you the Revelator of the goddesses or the one who belongs to the mighty power of the darkness?{nl}The evil darkness can not cross here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003966	You've proven that you are the Revelator of the goddesses.{nl}You may enter the room where the revelation is located.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003967	It's so brutal. {nl}Our Great Cathedral, to those demons...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003968	Druid Ellie
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003969	Hello. This is the garden of Ginaga.{nl}This place is the hometown and the land of Druid Master, Gina Greene.{nl}The master welcomes all people who visit this land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003970	You must have traveled various places in the kingdom.{nl}I am sorry, but do you know anything about the mysterious girl?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003971	The girl left these trees before Medzio Diena.{nl}My master asked me to find about the trees, but I knew nothing about them...{nl}I want to get help from you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003972	We should find out if they just imply some kind of a symbol or they are endowed with some kind of power.{nl}Please first collect the leaves of Ellum at the neglected grape fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003973	This girl had a mysterious energy.{nl}A long time ago, she traveled across the kingdom and left many forecasts and miracles.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003974	Recently, we saw a similar looking girl at the Crystal Mine. {nl}But, strangely, she wasn't able to say anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003975	Ellums are the monsters that were created in mass after Medzio Diena.{nl}If the trees here are endowed with some kind of power, the leaves of Ellum should react to them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003976	This will be enough. {nl}Let me concentrate for a bit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003977	Revelator, this is amazing!{nl}When we endowed the power of the trees to the leaves of the monsters that you brought, they waned right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003978	If that's the case... Please get me two lumps of sample soil corrupted with evil energy.{nl}I want to know more about the power of this tree.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003979	Before, evil energy was purified by the power of humans.{nl}But, if the power of this tree is true... they will be purified by planting it at several places.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003980	So you brought them.{nl}I just finished the preparation for the purification ritual.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003981	I will see the responses of this sample like the leaves.{nl}I hope it goes well.. Please see it yourself Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003982	Oh goddess, please look at this. The ritual was successful.{nl}The master would purify everything at once with trees like this one.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003983	Until the master comes back, I am going to do some base work for the large scale purification.{nl}Can you collect the five bottles of Tanus fluids from the Kvie Farm Area?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003984	Thanks for helping me.{nl}The girl who left this tree.. who was she I wonder?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003985	This tree is so mysterious.{nl}It's like the Revelator brought the clues of purification.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003986	You've done enough.{nl}I should tell the Druid Master that you've been a great help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003987	Ah, I have one last thing to request of you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003988	This is a box that we discovered that contains more of these trees.{nl}If you get a chance to go to Shaton Farm, please give it to Druid Martinek.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003989	He likes to interfere with others' lives so he may be involved in some kind of matter.{nl}Maybe you should ask the people there about his whereabouts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003990	Farm Supervisor Dorn
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003991	This is the private land of Shaton. {nl}Even a Revelator should not interfere here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003992	Farmer Max
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003993	Wheat farming is possible here unlike Shaton Farm.{nl}We were able to harvest the last farming... but...{nl}I am worried about the next farming.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003994	Farmer Darcy
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003995	Blast it. We might have to leave this place.{nl}We were able to harvest and live due to the care of Gina Greene, but it's too hard now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003996	Monsters are the bigger problem we have at the moment besides failing harvesting due to vicious energy.{nl}If you could move out the monsters, then we may be able to endure little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003997	We may be able to stand until the harvest season.{nl}But, the land is getting more and more corrupted, so one day it may turn just like the thorn forest.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003998	To receive unexpected help from you..{nl}You and the druids are all trying hard, so I can't just give up like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003999	We were lucky though. Do you know the Druid Master?{nl}Gina Greene, the owner of this farm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004000	She lent me the land without asking for any consideration after I lost my hometown due to Medzio Diena.{nl}But, what should I do now. Harvesting is becoming ineffective, and the number of monsters is increasing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004001	I was so thankful until now, but I can't let the families starve..{nl}If the vicious energy of the garden does not get removed, we have no choice, but to leave.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004002	Did you feel something strange while you were coming here?{nl}I mean the dandelions. They are big compared to the ones in other places.. and they are quite threatening.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004003	We should pull them out while they are sprouts, otherwise they could cover the whole farm.{nl}But due to the monsters, we can't continue our work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004004	It may be a lethargic excuse.{nl}We lost our hometown and we can't even farm on the land that we hardly deserve.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004005	I should help you somehow since you helped me a lot.{nl}I will pay attention from now on. I won't lose to those monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004006	Matilda, the young lady of the farm
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004007	This is my hometown that I returned after a long time and it has changed a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004008	Farmer Miren
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004009	I want the druids to drive the monsters out, but they're all focused on that tree.{nl}It's infuriating me. Who is that girl anyway? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004010	Hey. You, Revelator. Please help me instead of just looking at me.{nl}I want you to drive out the monsters that are on my fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004011	The girl the druids are talking about.{nl}I don't know about the tree, but I think it will bring disaster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004012	I can't farm due to the evil energy and also those monsters..{nl}I've been farming here for a long time, but ever since that girl came here and left, we've had only trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004013	I know that I've lived here for my whole life, but young people should not lie.{nl}Are you telling me the tree or the girl could be of help? That's nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004014	Thanks, really.{nl}You are way better than those useless druids there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004015	I would have driven out all druids if it weren't Gina Greene.{nl}When I was running away from the monsters last time, they saved me, but they don't look after me after that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004016	Okay, good. Please find my bag.{nl}I was so busy then, I forgot everything about that bag.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004017	There are many farmers here so there may be bags of other people here as well.{nl}There are name tags in the bags so please do not mix them up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004018	Where did I lose it?{nl}I fell down once somewhere..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004019	Thank you so much for finding my bag. {nl}Now that I look at it, I can't blame the druids. They all have hard times right now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004020	Alchemist George
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004021	I came here to get the useful ingredients of alchemy, but I can't move my body..{nl}I have an important experiment soon, but there's no one who could help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004022	Investigator Monahan
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004023	I came here from Klaipeda.{nl}To investigate the damage on the farms of this kingdom since Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004024	You must know that there isn't enough food in the kingdom.{nl}If you are okay, can you help me with my investigation?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004025	That's so thankful.{nl}First, please get me the eggs of the monsters first. I have something to check.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004026	There are places that need me so I feel very thankful. {nl}But, my stamina is not like before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004027	Well done.{nl}With this, we should be able to know how much evil energy has accumulated so far.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004028	That's strange. I thought I should give up on this place, but some other energies are mixed together.{nl}To know this, we need something that received the energy of the ground strongly. Could you help me a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004029	Please take a look at the roots of grapevine closely at the Avarza Grape Farm.{nl}The other monsters' eggs must be adjacent to them. I want you to bring me about three of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004030	Please be careful since you may get hurt when you touch the egg houses.{nl}It is a good habit to be always be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004031	Good. The sacred energy is slowly spreading in the ground.{nl}Since you helped me, we don't have to give up on this garden.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004032	But, that energy is too weak and it is from the kind that I barely knows.{nl}Maybe the druids should know about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004033	Shaton Family's Private Officer Hartman
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004034	I will help you so please move out before I scold you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004035	You can't enter here unless you have the permission.{nl}But, it may be possible.. You know what I am saying right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004036	If that's so, come back after defeating those Drakes.{nl}Ah, and don't forget to bring me the evidence. I've got something to report.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004037	This place is the private farm of the Shaton family.{nl}No one can enter except for tenant farmers and the people who are permitted to enter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004038	If you are gonna keep spouting nonsense such as pollution, you better move out of here fast.{nl}Or... there is another way to get the permission from me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004039	If you receive something, then you shuld also give up something.{nl}You thought you would be able to enter without any charges here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004040	Very well. From now on, you will be able to enter the farm whenever you want.{nl}But, you should do something about my underlings though.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004041	Are you looking for Druid? I know where he is. {nl}The soldiers levied the tax, but it's not enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004042	I am sure that he hid it away, but I don't know where it is.{nl}The brown pocket with the grains in it. If you understood it, come fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004043	It's going to take more time to look for the druid if you take more and more time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004044	Great work. Well done.{nl}The druid that you are looking for actually came here before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004045	He talked about the labor conditions of the farmers, so I sent him away with some petty excuse.{nl}He just walked off after I told him that the farmers at the workplace and the brewery weren't returning{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004046	What, that's wasn't a lie so that shouldn't be a problem.{nl}Go to Neshiva Road.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004047	I was acting kindly to the druid because of the neighbouring farm located not far from here.{nl}Remember, if you annoy me, I will expel you from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004048	Druid Martinek
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004049	You have something for me?{nl}Hold on. You came at the right time. I have to first save these people.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004050	Druidin Joel
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004051	We need lots of help here.{nl}Could you help them with me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004052	I will pay attention to your story later.{nl}First, here's an antidote, please use it to cure the poisoned farmers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004053	This is just emergency care, so I'll stay here to make more medicine.{nl}The locations that are indicated on the report are Zirta Brewery and Gausa Workplace. Please, hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004054	Shaton Farm looks peaceful at first sight.{nl}But, this land is polluted with evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004055	I know that purification is important,{nl}but if we don't save those poisoned farmers right away, they may lose their lives.{nl}As a druid, how can I leave those people behind?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004056	Please hurry. {nl}I assume they won't die very soon, but they must be suffering a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004057	It's fortunate that you came when you did, or else we would've been in big trouble.{nl}By the way, did you need anything from me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004058	I see, so Ellie finally found the true nature of the trees.{nl}And the seeds of those trees are in this box.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004059	But these seeds are too old, we need to endow them with the power of nature.{nl}Could I borrow your help, please?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004060	I will borrow some power from the frogs with wings.{nl}Could you exhaust them and bring them back using this stick?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004061	These are the seeds that were discovered with the tree that the mysterious girl had left.{nl}We also found out that these seeds are that of those trees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004062	But, since no one knew about what these trees really were, we never thought about planting them.{nl}However, I will use these seeds to engage in the large scale purification.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004063	It is not a hard task for a druid to revive old seeds.{nl}Of course, it will be important to look for a place to plant them first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004064	Make sure that the monster is alive.{nl}We can only use its power if it's alive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004065	Well done. {nl}If we now give them a moist environment, they will become healthy seeds.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004066	However, the areas nearby are too polluted with evil energy. We will need a specific type of water.{nl}The water at the well of Gausa Workplace may work..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004067	It's dangerous to go alone, so take this with you.{nl}This is a plate that is used in the ritual ceremony of the druids.{nl}It will purify the evil energy by a little bit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004068	The stream near here is too polluted.{nl}The water at the well of Gausa Workplace should be okay since they are located far below underground.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004069	It's so fortunate to see you are okay. {nl}Let's start the ritual soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004070	Alright, let's start. {nl}This is a simple ritual, so it should be quick.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004071	You came.{nl}I guess I didn't plan for this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004072	Farm Soldier Gedson
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004073	Even if you are the Revelator, this is a private land. {nl}Go out if you don't have any business here!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004074	If that's so, come back after defeating Cysts up there.{nl}After seeing how you behaved, I will think about whether I would just let it go or not.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004075	I can't do this anymore.{nl}This place is corrupted with evil energy and they are not even paying me a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004076	Good. I appreciate that.{nl}But, it doesn't mean I will let you go just yet. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004077	The one who makes me most annoyed is Drake.{nl}He is violent and looks disgusting. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004078	Come back after defeating the drake at Ishicla farming road. {nl}I won't say anything if you could do that for me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004079	Those monsters are doing well even if the evil energy and the poison is all over the place.{nl}This world is such an unfair place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004080	As I promised, I won't say anything for your intrusion into the farm before.{nl}But, this is just my jurisdiction. Behave yourself.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004081	The woman at the far, Charlotte
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004082	I don't wanna see Shaton family and those soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004083	Tenant Farmer Charlotte
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004084	Please help us.{nl}We have to grow things like this, they will all die within a short period of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004085	A lot of grapes were spoiled due to the evil energy.{nl}If this continues, people could die.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004086	Please spray the herbicide on the grape vines without those soldiers knowing about it.{nl}If they find out that the grapes are not growing, Shaton might change his mind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004087	When was it.. I believe it was way back before Medzio Diena.{nl}There was a girl in worn out clothes who told us, with an{nl}awkward accent and gestures, that the disaster would come.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004088	Medzio Diena came not long after that.{nl}Just like that girl said, I personally think the spoiled grapes are a part of the disaster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004089	I cannot fathom why he wants to harvest even those..{nl}I am sure that Shaton, the owner of this farm, has gone crazy.{nl}It surprises me to see how a person could change that much after losing his son.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004090	What? A forest is covered with thorns and vines?{nl}I like grapes, but these grapes are spoiled with evil energy.. That's horrible, don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004091	Thank you very much. I understand the son of Shaton is missing, but still..{nl}I have no doubt that he went crazy because of that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004092	Damn!{nl}Chupakabras came after smelling the polluted grape vines dried to their deathes.{nl}What should we do?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004093	If you go near the bushes, the hidden monsters may suddenly appear.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004094	I am relieved.{nl}Thank you. Now, it will be better if Shaton regains his consciousness.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004095	Farmer Louise
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004096	Shaton farm was not the place to live long ago.{nl}But, at least, it wasn't like this before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004097	Pächter Louis
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004098	I am having a hard time because of the supervisor and the soldiers.{nl}They want me to go to the Zirta Brewery.. I think they are trying to kill me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004099	Hey. I am sorry, but I don't have any power.{nl}If you are okay, could you go to Zirta Brewery and defeat Tontus nearby?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004100	The soldiers want bribes and the supervisor doesn't care even if anything happens to us.{nl}And Shaton takes the taxes in the amount that would barely keep us alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004101	If we don't listen to them, I am sure they will just ask for more bribes.{nl}In the end we either starve to death, or risk our lives.{nl}The old days when his son was the owner were much better.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004102	Even if the monsters get defeated, the peaceful time wouldn't contine for a long time. The monsters would come again soon. {nl}But, do you think I can think about tomorrow when I am having hard times now?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004103	I'm really grateful that you did this for me.{nl}I'm also thankful to the druid here. You and him are good people.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004104	I want to ask you one more favor.{nl}There are some seeds that aren't corrupted yet. It's because I secretly stashed them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004105	I hid them well by avoiding the eyes of the soldiers, but the monsters blew them away.{nl}Could you get me those back? They are in the square of the farm.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004106	I can't do this anymore.{nl}Once I get those seeds back, I will leave this farm and start my own farm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004107	Thank you very much for retrieving it.{nl}I understand that Shaton has lost his son, but still..{nl}I've heard that they are recruiting tenant farmers near Klaipeda's suburbs.{nl}Maybe I should go there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004108	I hope Shaton thinks about the people who are starving a little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004109	I heard about Mr. Shaton being stubborn, but I did not know he was this stubborn.{nl}If we don't somehow persuade him, the evil energy can possibly spread across the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004110	You may have listened to me.{nl}But, if only you could somehow convince him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004111	Gord Shaton
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004112	Are you working with that druid?{nl}Are you here to tell me to plant those useless trees at my son's farm?{nl}How preposterous.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004113	If we fail to persuade Shaton..{nl}Then our next move is to meet with his daughter.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004114	I will hear no more about this 'purification'.{nl} Leave my lands at once!

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004119	Look, I believe what the druid said was right.{nl}I will help you, so that my father can give up on the vineyard.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004120	My brother left to investigate the underground tunnels but never came back.{nl}If you can find traces of my brother in the underground tunnels..{nl}I guess my father could realize the truth.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004121	You haven't found any traces of my brother yet?{nl}There are quite a few underground tunnels near the farm, so please look in every single one of them.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004134	Hmm... If you have something to do in my farm, I won't block you.{nl}But, you should not disturb my subordinates or my farmers! Do you understand?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004140	I will leave this farm to my daughter from now on.{nl}My daughter can make wise decisions. I am sorry and I want to thank you for making me realize the truth.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004142	Instead of me explaining, it will be better if you explain it.{nl}The reason why Shaton gave up his obsesseion is because of you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004143	Yes. My father has told me about it.{nl}I am planning to plant the trees with the help of the druid in this farm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004144	I will give up on harvesting the grapes. And I will improve the labor conditions of the tenant farmers. {nl}I believe that my brother, who is with the goddesses right now, would have done the same.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004149	You must think this farm is strange, right?{nl}You probably don't understand why they are growing the spoiled grapes, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004150	This is the farm where Shaton is awaiting his lost son.{nl}It is why I cannot turn my back against my master. Wouldn't you agree?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004151	If that's so, then I have a request for you.{nl}I will pay you handsomely. Please get rid of the Carcashus who are ruining this farm.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004154	As you can imagine, there are many people with stomach aches due to the spoiled grapes.{nl}That's why I sent people to Klaipeda to buy medicine.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004156	Since I am going to share them with all the people in the farm, we need a lot.{nl}I hope my master will also eat it, but I don't know if he's going to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004157	Regrettably, the soldiers here only listen to the orders of the master.{nl}Thanks, I will use the medicine well.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004163	Obsessed, perhaps too obsessed.{nl}I feel sorry for Shaton.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004164	Well done. This is my reward to you, as promised.{nl}I have tons of work here, so you can always come back if you want.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004165	It's you again. You just have to defeat Raujinutes across the tunnel.{nl}My subordinates don't wanna go that place since it is somewhat spooky.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004166	Please defeat Raujintes this time as well.{nl}We are almost seeing the end so keep up the good work at the tunnel just little bit more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004167	I think Shaton will be satisfied now.{nl}Well done. Oh and, don't tell any others about this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004168	Oh my god. You must have gone crazy.{nl}I heard Scorpio appeared near the Wind Vane Tower because of you. You should be responsible for this!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004169	My useless subordinates already ran away.{nl}Quick, go to the Wind Vane Tower.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005633	Strange isn't it? How come the food gets spoiled whenever I cross over there?{nl}Is it because of the smoke?{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005635	If they really are getting spoiled due to the smoke, I wonder what it is...{nl}It can't be good for your health, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005636	I actually suspected that those round things were making the smoke.{nl}They always said it was created by the baron, and that a harvester like me couldn't possibly know anything about that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005637	So did the smoke go away?{nl}That's the first time I've seen such a thing.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005641	What? The crops died after doing what you were told to do?{nl}Was the curse of the doll little strong?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005643	Are you the Revelator? {nl}I don't care about that, I am a bit busy right now so could you help my task?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005644	There are some magic circles around here that we put after receiving the order of Baron Allerno.{nl}The magic circle blocks the strange energy in this region and supplies the magical power onto this generator.{nl}But, since the power of the magic circle is weak, we need to enhance it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005645	{nl}The true Revelator would find the way to enhance the magic circle just by looking at it.{nl}Take the bottles since you may need them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005646	The power generator works by using the grains that are piled up at the storage over there.{nl}That's why I needed them a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005647	{nl}The tenants are cooperating with us without any resistance.{nl}...Anyways, I am worried since that storage gets attacked by the monsters frequently these days.{nl}I guess that's not strange since we piled up the grains like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005648	I can only say it's the power generator that helps the important gate which connects the two places to stay open.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005650	What is that? Is that the head part of the sculpture? Give it to me. I got something to check.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005652	That's the lower body part of the sculpture...?{nl}Give it to me.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005656	What? A person came out from the sack? What the hell?{nl}I really don't know anything. How could I know anything? I came from a different farm.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005658	This land is too infertile and the monsters have taken all the seeds.{nl}Can you find the seeds that the monsters took?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005659	You haven't gotten enough of the seeds back yet.{nl}I am sorry, but can you get me some more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005660	I put them well in small bags.{nl}I think the monsters who took them ran away to Tvora Road.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005661	If I ask the baron to give me seeds again, he may hit me. {nl}The soldiers can't say anything to the baron either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005662	Oh, yes. This is it.{nl}Unfortunately, this isn't all that was taken.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005663	Now we have enough seeds. {nl}Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005664	Where did Manticen hide?{nl}It's about the time that I should feed him.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005666	I am doing many tasks that the baron told me to do.{nl}Well... something like feeding...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005667	If you find it, throw this meat to lure it.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005670	We can make lots of weapons with the leather and the stonese.{nl}Right now, we don't have enough leather.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005671	The monsters are perfect to get the materials.{nl}You can also get the leathers from the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005672	Now we should collect some poison.{nl}It will be used diversely.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005673	{nl}My grandmother taught me this method.{nl}It is the method to obtain some specific substancees from the things nearby.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005674	The farming tools are used to crave the land so they can be also used as weapons.{nl}But, we definitely need the cooperation from the tenant famers...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005675	Please extract some Nioles from there.{nl}Niole is a thankful flower.{nl}You can make soups with the grains and they can also be used as herbs.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005685	There's a magic circle at the entrance of Tarvas.{nl}You should break that first.{nl}But the monsters always disturb it..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005686	Now we are almost done!{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005687	It seems that the pieces that he gave to me belong to the statue of the goddess.{nl}This must be... the trace of those barons manipulating something on this ground and breaking it afterwards.{nl}You who collected these...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005688	I am collecting the traces here.{nl}I can't tell you in details, but I am preparing for something big.{nl}To do that, I need to persuade the tenant farmers.{nl}So I am collecting those.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005697	The barons are pludering a lot these days and the magic circles like that have been created a lot across this region. Some of them are less shiny.{nl}Anyways, you get hurt from the ones that shine more so it's hard to eliminate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005698	You came at the right time. I connected the pieces with some sticky stuff.{nl}...As I expected. This is a Goddess Statue.{nl}I could only glue them like this with my skill... It will break again if I don't do it well.{nl}I am sorry that I just glued them like this...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005802	Savior. You are now ready to know the truth.{nl}The reason why I am just leaving Hauberk like that is because he too is the key to close the space of the metastasis.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005805	How come Vakarine left Hauberk to go crazy like that..{nl}I guess she must have a reason for that.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006182	Don't worry. We'll have a good harvest if we solve the corruption problem. {nl}And if that portal is also maintained.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006183	It's the Old Food Storage warehouse site. {nl}After all, there's a pile of crops there, so the monsters could prey on it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006184	I can't leave this place because I have to guard it. {nl}But I can't make the baron go himself either.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006188	I had a hard time gathering it from the monsters and refining it. {nl}Don't worry. Even evil auras can be useful, depending on how you handle it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006189	(Something doesn't feel right about this liquid...{nl}To enhance the magic circle with this sounds suspicious, but let's give it a try.)

QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006199	I just happened to take the lead like this. {nl}I'm just a tenant farmer who could no longer stand the baron's exploitation and tyranny.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006200	What makes us even more angry is that he is trying to fool us under the guise of purification. {nl}All he does is a disgrace to the goddess' name.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006201	Please get some wooden rods from the wooden structures nearby. {nl}We're going to make weapons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006202	We don't know how much we can fight the baron's guards. {nl}But we fight, that will have some meaning.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006203	This will be about enough. {nl}I will tell you more later, but if what I suspect is right, the baron betrayed the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006204	The baron is said to have ordered the magic circles to be put up around the farm to suppress the strange aura. {nl}But that was a lie. The baron is not interested in purification. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006205	Please help us get leather for making weapons. {nl}You can get it from the monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006206	There are strange auras spread all over the farm.{nl}The baron said they were dangerous and gave orders to make magic circles to suppress them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006207	But nobody was hurt by the strange aura. {nl}It's ridiculous. Instead, the crops grew rather well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006208	We won't just stand by anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006209	That will be enough. Thank you. {nl}To be honest, I don't care what the baron wants. {nl}But...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006210	I mean even if what the baron wants really is purification. {nl}With my colleagues gone, it's nonsense that I have to bear the expensive farm rent fees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006211	That's what I think. Now... I have to collect poison. {nl}It will be useful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006212	I'm not sure if this is his weak point. {nl}But I think something is hidden in the Aqueduct Bridge Area's Restricted Area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006213	He's a greedy old man so there must be something. I'm sure of it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006214	Place the poison pot, lure the monster to it, then kill it. {nl}Bring it to me when enough is collected.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006215	I'm sorry for having to ask something like this of you. {nl}But please feel pity on us and help us out a little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006216	I'm thinking about borrowing farm tools from the farmers nearby for improvised weapons. {nl}You are a famous Revelator, so it should be fairly easy for you to convince them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006217	If you persuade them with the letter I give you, they will understand.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006218	So many... Thank you so much. {nl}Oh, and if you have time, I hope you can help my colleagues as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006219	I am Horacius' colleague. I'm in charge of the food supplies.{nl}The promised day is coming, but we don't have enough manpower. Can you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006220	We will support Horacius.{nl}Everyone is tired of the unreasonable farm rent fees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006221	The baron secretary used to protect us, but now they're gone...{nl}We have only our own two hands to trust.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006222	Then please collect Nioles from Riaum Hill.{nl}We can use them with potatoes to make soup, and they're also used as medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006223	Even if the baron did something right, he only did it for himself. {nl}No one can blame us for what we're doing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006224	Dried food has a long shelf life.{nl}You'll feel full even when you consume only a small amount of beef jerky.{nl}That's why we're accumulating a lot of it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006225	The farm rent fees have become a burden recently.{nl}The baron used weird reasons to collect them more often.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006226	My colleague even disappeared one day.{nl}Since then, whatever the baron says about purification and all seem like a lie.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006227	I believe all this has something to do with the baron.{nl}I want to find out what it is, even if I have to resort to violence.{nl}Horacius agrees too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006228	You need to get edible meat from the monsters nearby.{nl}Once we have the meat, you just have to place it in the dryer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006229	The point is to get edible meat from the monsters.{nl}Most of them are tough and fishy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006230	Thank you very much. {nl}We need to be full to fight well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006231	Lastly... The problem is that the monsters frequently prey on the food storage house. {nl}There is a fella guarding that place but it's constanly exposed to danger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006232	The Food Storage is at Vinoga Brewery.{nl}Do you think it's already too late though?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006233	The storage keeper told me to thank you for him.{nl}Oh, and if you see my colleagues asking for help, please help them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006234	Are you the Revelator?{nl}News like that reaches us, even out here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006235	I'm helping Horacius remove the baron's magic circles.{nl}If it's alright, can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006236	The baron said the strange aura is dangerous and told us not to go near it.{nl}But I don't think that's the case.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006237	It's actually similar to the aura I felt from the giant statue of Goddess Zemyna in Fedimian.{nl}I wonder if it actually purifies the land instead.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006238	Let's see. Now there are around 3 left. {nl}Darbas Entrance, Padeka Altar, and the Fallow Ground.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006239	The people in this farm used to pray to Goddess Zemyna from the Padeka Altar.{nl}After the baron made magic circles though, the monsters took over that place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006240	I can only assume that the monsters were drawn to the magic circle. {nl}The magic circle is suppressing the divine power of the altar..? or something.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006241	It's a monster called Kirmeleech. {nl}Don't forget to remove the magic circle after defeating the monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006242	It's been a while since we've offered prayers because of Kirmeleech. {nl}What if the goddess is angry?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006243	Good job.{nl}Now we can pray to Goddess Zemyna again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006244	The magic circle at Fallow Ground has protective barriers so it's difficult to destroy it right away. {nl}I will give you some Magic Stones of Blessing. Try using these to destroy it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006245	I used to take priest lessons before Medzio Diena. {nl}I'm here now because I like farming more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006246	You will get hurt if you go near the magic circle rashly. {nl}Be sure to destroy the magic circle using magic stone of blessings.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006247	You did it! {nl}Now this farm is back to looking the way it should.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006248	This is the last one. {nl}The magic circle in Tarvas Entrance will have a lot of monsters interfering. {nl}With the divine power suppressed, the monsters are naturally drawn to that area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006249	The magic circle isn't attracting the monsters, but it's suppressing the divine power.{nl}That's why the monsters are gathering.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006250	All the magic circles in this farm are destroyed.{nl}Now we can only hope for Horacius' work to succeed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006251	This looks like part of the Goddess Statue that used to stand.{nl}Seems like someone destroyed it on purpose... Could it be the baron?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006252	You don't look like one of the baron's people at least.{nl}We need help. We want to revive this farm and we'll do whatever it takes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006253	The Baron is doing something to purify this farm. {nl}But recently the crops are dying and people are starting to fall sick. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006254	I couldn't believe it at first, but if this piece is really from a Goddess Statue.. {nl}Either the baron is lying to us or something is wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006255	First, I better stick the pieces together. {nl}It may be a little blasphemous but can you get some Sticky Sap from the monsters?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006256	I feel like it's soiling the Goddess Statue but I have nothing else so we'll have to settle for that. {nl}The goddess will forgive us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006257	Yes. That will be enough. Let me try sticking this together first. {nl}Oh, and one more thing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006258	The baron has a bad reputation because of the things he has done. {nl}And for what he's been up to nowadays.. He must be planning on something. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006259	Some people say 'the baron is human, after all', so he won't do such things. {nl}So we need to collect clues to persuade them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006260	If you head toward the crossroad, you'll see an oddly sparkling smoke. {nl}Attack a monster and take it there before killing it. You might find something out, don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006261	No results yet? {nl}There should be some reaction whether good or bad if you check using the monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006262	Surely suspicious. {nl}If that aura is a bad aura, it wouldn't attack a monster, right? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006263	I've got good evidence thanks to you. {nl}This might be enough to persuade the others. Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006264	Varas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006265	No matter how much I think about it, the magic circles are the reason the harvest is bad. {nl}It's not purifying the land but rather making it worse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006266	Even if this is the baron's order, this is too much. {nl}But what can I do when all I've ever held was a plow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006267	This area used to be a fertile land. {nl}But ever since the baron's men made the magic circles, harvests decreased a lot. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006268	Purify? That's not even funny. {nl}We farmers know better about this land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006269	You can remove it by lighting fire with my firewood. {nl}But there is a protective shell so even if you light fire, the fire will easily die out. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006270	I think it's better to get kindlings from the Dandels all over the area to keep the fire.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006271	I can't stand paying ridiculous farm rent fees at times like this. {nl}How can he do that, as a human?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006272	Did you do it? {nl}That's great. But there are more magic circles.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006273	If the magic circles are really a like, then you should be able to remove the magic circles in Talia trails with Goddess' power. {nl}I mean something like the Goddess Statue. Is there any way to get it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006274	If the magic circles really are for the better, I can just pay more rent and ask for forgiveness. {nl}We'll know for sure if we check with the goddess' power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006275	But if it isn't, the baron better be prepared. {nl}He fooled us, harmed the land, and betrayed close friends.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006276	Indeed Joana has it. Use that power to remove the magic circle. {nl}Then checking the crops around will confirm it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006277	You're just in time. {nl}You said you needed this Goddess Statue, right? Here, take it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006278	{memo X duplicate line}I used the Sticky Sap to glue the pieces and indeed, it was a Goddess Statue. {nl}But this is all I can do so.. It might break easily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006279	The magic circle will be a problem whether it's good or bad. {nl}But at least, it's better than begging the baron.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006280	I used the Sticky Sap to glue the pieces and indeed, it was a Goddess Statue. {nl}But this is all I can do so.. It might break easily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006281	Alright. Thank you very much. {nl}At least now we know the magic circle is bad for sure. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006282	Anyway, I feel bad for the Goddess Statue being broken, but don't be so discouraged. {nl}The goddess will forgive us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006283	If the magic circle can't be removed by the power of the goddess, the baron had better be prepared. {nl}He will probably claim that the power of the goddess is evil. I'll watch what he has to say.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006284	Have you seen the crops pouch the monsters took from me? {nl}Can you please help me find it? I need to pay for the farm rent.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006285	If I don't pay, I will surely be kicked out this time. {nl}Please help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006286	Thank you very much. {nl}I worked so hard to gather it all and they just threw it to the monsters.. Those awful guards..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006287	There is an unstable magic circle on the way to Ramus Crossroads. {nl}They say to not go near it because a strange aura flows out from it. But it really doesn't seem so. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006288	It's full of suspicious stuff. {nl}I have to glue these pieces together so can you check that aura for me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006289	Thank you for helping us. {nl}From now on, we won't just stand back.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006290	I hope the goddess blesses your journey..{nl}Please wish us luck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006291	Revelator, it is time. {nl}Now we will do what we have to do.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006292	Good work. {nl}With so many demons defeated, her vigor should be softened.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006293	The servants of Hauberk who lost their commander started to follow her. {nl}They essentially betrayed Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006294	It's retrieving the Mark that Hauberk gave his servants as sign of loyalty. {nl}Go to 2nd Isolation Area. They must be gathered there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006295	Even now, Hauberk's servants think Nuaele is Hauberk. {nl}But if Hauberk gets back his marks, then they will realize who the real master is. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006296	But Nuaele is acting strangely. {nl}With the powers she's been collecting, it's actually enough to break through the barrier. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006297	You will need Hauberk's help. {nl}Hauberk is also a demon so he must be able to read the thoughts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006298	She planned to make this Demon Prison her demonic world from the start. {nl}If this place falls under her hands, not even Ausrine will be able to do anything about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006299	What about striking the monsters in 4th Isolation Area first? {nl}If we defeat them, it will be like gettting rid of Nuaele's strongest weapons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006300	They used to be Hauberk's servants. I'm sure Hauberk doesn't need them anymore. {nl}They ran to Nuaele right away the minute Hauberk was sealed and gave her the Piece of Seal.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006301	Nuaele was eliminated, but the demons at the 4th isolated area are still not following her order.{nl}If you don't eliminate her fragments from them, the demons would move again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006302	{nl}We should not let this kind of thing occur again in the future.{nl}Please retrieve the fragments of Nuaele by defeating the demons at the 4th isolated area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006303	It will take a long time to re-establish order in the prison.{nl}It will take a long time, just like Nuaele did preparing for now..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006304	Thanks. I will break the fragments myself. {nl}I wish the Goddesses protect you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006305	Nuaele is engaged in the ritual to summon the demons in his area at the moment.{nl}However, since his arms and legs are all disconnected, it's going to be easy to defeat him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006306	You've eliminated the gigantic space of the metastasis, but there are too many demons that came across so far..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006307	We have to use the last method.{nl}Please retrieve the symbols of the seal which was put on the demons that had strong power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006308	The symbol of seal would absorb the one's power whose name is engraved on the seal.{nl}You would be able to obtain the power if you defeat the demons at Atmesta isolated area with the runes of the night star.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006309	We weren't able to monitor all the demons in the prision.{nl}That's why we engraved the symbol of the seal on them so they can't be found.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006310	Well done.{nl}You would be able to enlarge the size of the spirit of Hauberk with these symbols.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006311	So the monsters were after this particular piece?{nl}This is also my first time seeing it.. I guess we should check Gaudeji Altar on the right side as well then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006312	That's why I lured the demons with the demonic stone..{nl}Those villagers were too hasty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006313	We should find out whether that is just a symbol or endowned with some kind of power.{nl}First, I want you to collect the toe nails of Lizardmen from the abandoned grape fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006314	Lizardmen are the monsters that appeared a lot after Medzio Diena.{nl}If some kind of power is in this tree, it will definitely react to the toe nails.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006315	Revelator, this is astonishing!{nl}After I put the power of the tree into the toe nails of the monster that you brought, it corroded right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006316	Now let's see how this sample will react.{nl}I hope it works out well.. You should also see it, Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006317	Until my master comes, I will prepare for a large-scale purification.{nl}Can you collect five bottles of Orange Tama body fluid at the Kvie Farm Area for me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006318	Right now, the bigger problem we have is the monsters, not the bad harvests.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006319	Hey you. Revelator. Don't just look at me. Help me.{nl}Please kick out Lizardmen on my fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006320	That's so thankful.{nl}Please get me the leaves that Tama is putting on. I got something to check.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006321	Please look at the lower side of the gravevine at Avarza Grape Farm.{nl}I need the root of it. Please get me three of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006322	Please be careful since if you touch the roots accidently, the poison may come out from them.{nl}Or the monsters may come out.{nl}It is a good habit to be careful always.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006323	If that's the case, please eliminate all short trees.{nl}Ah, don't forget to bring the evidence as well. I need something to report.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006324	Are you looking for the druid? Of course I know where he is. {nl}But you know, we soldiers have been collecting rent, and it doesn't seem enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006325	The Stumpy Trees are most irritating.{nl}They are violent, and they also look disgusting.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006326	Please just defeat the short trees at Zole Farm. {nl}If you could do that, I won't say anything anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006327	Listen. I am really sorry, but I don't have any power.{nl}If you don't mind, could you defeat all the Cysts at Zirta Brewery?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006328	The soldiers want bribes and the supervisor doesn't care at all, even if something happens to us.{nl}The current owner of this farm, Shaton, takes a lot of rent from us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006329	I hid them well without being discovered by the soldiers, but there are monsters roaming.{nl}Is it possible for you to retrieve it back for me? It's at the Farm Plaza.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006330	Hey, I will give you some of my commission, so are you interested in doing some work?{nl}It's a simple task, just get all the pink root moles that are across the underground tunnels.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006331	It's you again. As usual, get rid of all the pink root moles across the underground tunnels.{nl}My men don't want to go there because they don't like the underground tunnels.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006332	Please, do continue your work on those moles.{nl}It's almost done, so keep up the good work just little bit more beyond the underground tunnels.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006333	Oh goddesses, What have you done?!{nl}I heard the Glass Mole has appeared near the Wind Vane Tower, and it's because of you! You should be responsible for it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006334	Do you still think I am the stone in your pocket?..{nl}You think I would be defeated?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007148	Our comrades who were attacked by Petrifying Frost... they are just left there without avoiding the rain and the wind.{nl}On top of that, we have a limited support... We have no choice, but to wait.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007149	But those damn monsters! They are attacking our colleagues.{nl}Please. Could you be with our colleagues to protect them for a while?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007150	My old friend, Galen is one of the victims.{nl}Please protect him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007151	Thank you so much.{nl}I hope the reinforcement comes soon so he could return to his family even if he is petrified.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007152	We didn't treat them badly, but they betrayed us.{nl}Dico Thieves stole the supplies from us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007153	They must have taken them to Drasos Chapel Ruins, but since I can't leave this place, I guess we all gonna die.{nl}I am sorry, but can you retrieve the supplies that were stolen by the thieves?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007154	A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp or stole the supplies secretly.{nl}They were punished for doing so, but I guess they forgot about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007155	They lured us in front of them and stole the goods from behind.{nl}We should set something up, but our chiefs are fighting against the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007156	We have one more trouble.{nl}I mean Sabina, who is a Knight of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007157	They are insisting that they would not go back until they find the damaged artifacts.{nl}We can't get out from this place so I don't know what they want us to do...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007158	The city that was destroyed a few hundreds years ago has no assets or no people to protect.{nl}I rather feel like protecting a historical site. Even tomb thieves are here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007159	Now, I just hope Sabina stays calm.{nl}We don't want to be like them here because of the Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007160	It's not an easy thing to ditch the Royal Army guards.{nl}I want to know the truth here. The truth which the soldiers really hate about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007161	I need your help since you don't seem to belong to any side.{nl}Could you make rubber copies of the records that are remaining here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007162	These are the records from the time when the Fortress of the Land collapsed.{nl}We could maybe know more about the Fortress of the Land from the headquarter of Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007163	But, the Fortress of the Land can't be entered because the Royal Army guards are restricting the access.{nl}Even the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007164	Maybe... we could restore the time of the portal that was used when we retreated from the Fortress of the Land.{nl}It is dangerous from this point on so if you are going to quit, please tell me now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007165	What we are planning right now could lead us to the gallows.{nl}Please keep it secret.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007166	When we were in the era of Premier Eminent, we were supported by the superior troops, lots of supplies and etc.{nl}But, 600 years have passed after Premier Eminent died.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007167	No matter how large the rebellion was, after experiencing Medzio Diena, our support waned. If anything, it's a question of whether we must remain here. For 600 years?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007168	I heard the Dico Thieves were well known thieves.{nl}I heard that they were separated on Medzio Diena... Anyways... what they are doing is like what bandits are doing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007169	I also know that there are thieves called Amanda Thieves. They were quiet.{nl}I want to know if they really exist or not since I never saw them before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007170	Both of them are criminals that we should catch when we receive more reinforcements.{nl}Especially, Dico Thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007171	We are observing what the researchers of the Knights of Kaliss are doing, and while pretending to be their guards.{nl}Sabina was one of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007172	They disappear and appear again using the artifacts that are remaining in the city so I have troubles chasing after them.{nl}But, were Chronomancers the people who investigate the portals?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007173	I really appreciate for your kindness, but it's not going to be easy. If it was easy, we would've found them already.{nl}I don't know why, but the monsters ate the artifacts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007174	This place is the cursed city of the traitor, Ruklys.{nl}It has been cursed with the Petrifying Frost since the end of the rebellion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007175	We will permit your entry since the Knights of Kaliss requested us to do so,{nl}but please remain at places where we can keep an eye on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007176	I don't know how great you were in the past,{nl}but you have to follow the rules of the kingdom here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007177	Benas asked us to secure the route that connects to the Fortress of the Land.{nl}Ah, he is the ruler of the kingdoms soldiers in this region.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007178	If you could defeat the monsters in the ruins, that will be the way to contribute to the goddesses and the kingdom.{nl}Of course, I promise you some rewards in return.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007179	It will not be bad to show us a good impression.{nl}Because this land is ruled by the Royal Army guards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007180	It wasn't done by the thieves. We are moving the objects to places where they could be utilized.{nl}It will be way better than them disappearing from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007181	Not bad.{nl}I guess the rumors don't always get exaggerated.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007182	We are activating the detectors here because of irregular Petrifying Frost that are blowing,{nl}but, there are no soldiers who could check that due to a recent battle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007183	So if you could do that for us, that will show us {nl}your loyalty to the kingdom and continue our efforts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007184	There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the device.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007185	The Petrifying Frost are to be blown from the two places.{nl}I heard you are a quite famous Revelator. Aren't you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007186	From some time ago, more soldiers are being attacked by Sparnashorn near the detectors.{nl}If you are the one from the rumor, you would be able to face against that monster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007187	Those soldiers are the ones who survived the Petrifying Frost and Sparnashorn.{nl}They can't fight against Sparnashorn since they paralyzed from fear. {nl}In this state they have no chance of defeating Sparnashorn.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007188	The Petrifying Frost has been delayed a bit.{nl}Whatever we do, there is no way to block the punishments that were brought by Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007189	Now the only thing that remains is Sparnashorn... Defeat it quickly and get out of there.{nl}Even a great Revelator like you can not withstand the Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007190	Retreating is also a tactic, but we can't always do it.{nl}We should finish it when we have an volunteer who is loyal and competent like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007191	Hearing that it was defeated is the most hopeful story I've heard in years. {nl}Now I better let the troops rest first and tell them the good news.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007192	Although I don't know you, I am glad to see you.{nl}It's good to be acquainted with someone here. Everyone should help each other out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007193	For example, help cleaning the monsters at our workplace.{nl}The gathering place. What do you think? Can you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007194	The kind of work I do is business secret so I can't tell you what it is... {nl}No one owns these things anyway. Finders keep them if them if they need them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007195	That fast? Have you not missed any of the monsters?{nl}Ahah. Those coward Royal Army guards won't get near here so don't worry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007196	You want to know how I got here? {nl}It's all because I have connections. There are some Royal Army guards who buy claws of the monsters to raise their work records.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007197	But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially here.{nl}If you could get me those claws, we will become really good friends.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007198	I think you are misunderstanding something.{nl}We are archaeologists, not thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007199	Thank you so much friend.{nl}Though this seems quite polished.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007200	I will tell you something. You better not think about getting something here.{nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Dico Thieves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007201	I don't want to see them more than those Royal Army guards.{nl}The goods they brought here from outside are piled up at the entrance route of the outer wall... {nl}What would occur if they all disappear?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007202	I took a sneak peek, but it seems they haven't returned yet.{nl}Move fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007203	Seems like Dico Thieves are planning to do their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the Royal Army?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007204	The terrible scene you can see in this city are the results of the rebellion that was carried out by Ruklys and the citizens 600 years ago.{nl}The Petrifying Frost that started to blow after suppressing the rebellion turn everything into stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007205	The kingdom would've been destroyed already if Premier Eminent wasn't present.{nl}If he was still alive... We may have got over these hard times sooner.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007206	That's the scary wind that turns everything into stones.{nl}After Medzio Diena, the occurrence of the wind varied irregularly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007207	Once you encounter the curse of the Petrifying Frost, you can't restore it.{nl}The sin of the traitor, Ruklys is that heavy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007208	The Knights of Kaliss is trying to find a remedy...{nl}The curse continued for 600 years. I don't think there's a remedy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007209	Sparnashorn appears with the wind of Petrifying Frost.{nl}To avoid the exhausted soldiers not get involved with it, we should avoid them fighting against Sparnashorn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007210	If we could eliminate the weak Petrifying Frost with this absorbing scroll at the great square, we may delay the time a bit.{nl}We would be able to lure Sparnashorn to the old market when the next Petrifying Frost blow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007211	I've a friend who's supposed to come here but he's nowhere to be found.{nl}I think something happened.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007212	He is hiding among the guards near the great square.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007213	He is hiding among the guards.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007214	Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.{nl}Did that stupid Hubertas send you here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007215	I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here.{nl}There is a big problem here actually.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007216	Our family can't come into the city from outside.{nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007217	I'm going to make big fuss at the great square. I'm going to call in Saltistter that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gather scented stone powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007218	Our families should have passed this place earlier than the Royal Army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Petrifying Frost swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007219	If you pour this here, you will soon see the Saltistter show up its huge body itself.{nl}But that is not our plan.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007220	We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through.{nl}Let's rub this powder onto the Rambears that appear at the great square.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007221	Then Saltistter will attack Rambears. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007222	Our families come from various areas.{nl}I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007223	Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map on Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007224	Did you use everything?{nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007225	Go to Retia and tell her that Saltistter is coming here.{nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Saltistter running at us. {nl}Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007226	You just have to tell her that Saltistter is coming.{nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007227	Our families passed through this place without any problems.{nl}Since you are still being trusted by our Royal Army guards, you will not be discovered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007228	This city... you will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area.{nl}And you may also meet our families.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007229	I don't want to be here either.{nl}I would not be here if I didn't receive the orders to support the Knights of Kaliss...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007230	Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place.{nl}Also the monsters are running wild so I can't just stay still.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007231	We have to be here until Kostas comes back.{nl}There are lot of things to do, so I hope he comes back soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007232	The officers don't like the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, the Knights of Kaliss give us supplies and supports so there's no reason for us to hate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007233	If we can find the Symbol of Silt, then we would be able to enter the area without any problems.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007234	I can't hear anything from Kostas.{nl}Ah... I don't know how I should report.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007235	The Royal Army guards, the Knights of Kaliss, and we grave robbers are forming an excellent balance.{nl}That's why people can at least walk around.. Before that, this place was not a place to stay.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007236	Much of the city remained in its original form 600 years after the misfortune due to Petrifying Frost.{nl}One of my missions here is to clear the records of rebels remaining here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007237	I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here.{nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area so I want you to take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007238	Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007239	I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007240	It is an old story,{nl}but many Royal Army guards came to this place to do a preliminary check to support for the research on the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007241	But, unlike their expectations, the Petrifying Frost were waiting for them.{nl}They died there... I want to get their keepsakes, but it's hard...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007242	The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the Royal Army and the Knights of Kaliss have become distant.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007243	Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it.{nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007244	Gofden...{nl}The Silt Certificate... Ah sorry I talked alone in front of you.{nl}When you are carrying this, you will not receive the curse of the Petrifying Frost. Don't you think that's amazing?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007245	People say you go around to save the world according to the will of the goddess?{nl}Then you could also save this city!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007246	Our employer does not support us any other funds besides the research funds to revive the city.{nl}That's why the wizards like me, who want to come up with some results are researching while avoiding the eyes of the Royal Army guards and the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007247	This will be enough.{nl}Good. Let's combine this with the Symbol of Silt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007248	We've succeeded the combination... but I can't predict how effective this would be.{nl}I will give you the Symbol of Silt so try using it on the monsters in this area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007249	If it's effective, then something would react to it.{nl}Maybe since the effects for the Petrifying Frost disappeared, it could take little faster. Anyways, I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007250	Since I handed over the Symbol of Silt to you, I am gonna be dead when the Petrifying Frost blow here.{nl}Please finish the task as quickly as possible.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007251	So it was effective right?{nl}Then now, I will amplify it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007252	Ah... I almost forgot.{nl}Even if I amplify the Symbol of Silt with the reacting stone, the power doesn't last eternally.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007253	Good, good... I will activate it only when the Petrifying Frost blow.{nl}I should obtain the detector somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007254	If you could bring me the detector, I will do the rest.{nl}You've contributed a lot in this experiment so I will give you the effects of the Symbol of Silt.{nl}Although it would not last long...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007255	There were experiments in the past.{nl}At Roxona Reconstruction Agency, there was a separate laboratory to research on the curse of the Petrifying Frost.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007256	But then demons rushed in...{nl}Most of them were killed by the demons or became petrified on the experimental devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007257	This Symbol of Silt... it reminds me of many things.{nl}It was too bad since the results of the experiments were appearing at that time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007258	They told me to protect the objects that are gathered at Gerove Workshop Site.{nl}Do you think this makes sense? Why don't they ask the monsters to protect it instead?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007259	Ah! We should just do it like that.{nl}Hey, could you help me a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007260	It's a good thing the cowardly Dico Thieves did not reach here yet.{nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take them away..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007261	If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007262	There are some boxes that our thieves left at Gerove Workshop.{nl}When you rub Velas Grass onto them, the monsters would rush in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007263	But, you gotta be careful.{nl}The monsters would not treat you preciously so run away after attacking them a little.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007264	I think I can leave this place for a while because of you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007265	You haven't seen Dico Thieves right?{nl}In fact, I haven't seen them as well, but Amanda told you to be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007266	Please take care of the monsters in the military district while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interfered.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007267	It's relatively safe on top of the fortress.{nl}There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.{nl}Of course, the Royal Army guards as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007268	I don't like it, having to guard here with the Knights of Kaliss around.{nl}You will never understand what it feels like to guard here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007269	Until now, I am sure that you've only seen the artifacts that stopped their time.{nl}But, it will be different from this point on since I came here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007270	I will proceed the test from up here.{nl}Please go to the portal and activate it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007271	Don't worry too much.{nl}Everything is just your memories at then so they won't do any harms to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007272	I am sorry. Aren't you hurt somewhere?{nl}I didn't know it would go over my expectations.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007273	What was that... demons? Are they really demons?{nl}I have no way of knowing. I guess I will have to tune up the portal that leads to the Fortress of the Land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007274	It is little dangerous... but, I want to suggest a deal to you.{nl}We are actually cooperating with Amanda thieves. Yes. I know it's insane.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007275	To obtain what you want, you should take this risk.{nl}Just help Amanda thieves to enter into the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007276	Would dead people come back if the curse is cured in this city?{nl}No, but the times after now are more important.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007277	We feel like we are risking our lives every seconds.{nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007278	We're different from those Dico Thieves.{nl}If you help well this time, I will surely pay you back someday.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007279	The guards were asking what the fuss was all about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007280	If you watch over the city from here, it feels like the time has stopped.{nl}However, many incidents are occurring everyday.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007281	We need to bring Stephonas here.{nl}He promised to get us the frost core which will help in studying the Petrifying Frost.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007282	We should empty the watermill ruins, but I might be suspected if I carry out the work...{nl}Since you are respected by the Royal Army guards, I want you to help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007283	They will reduce their boundaries as they are get attacked.{nl}Or bring a huge army in... but, they won't be able to do that with the current state of the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007284	Now, please lure the guards at the watermill ruins.{nl}Just tell them the monsters are going crazy at Estuary Bank Three Ways.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007285	Stephonas will pass by secretly.{nl}Of course, you will receive their respects.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007286	Rofdel will be watching from the watchtower but on a foggy day like this, it's useless.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007287	Stephonas passed through safely.{nl}He was looking for you. Go and help him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007288	The guards won't mention our names to Rofdel.{nl}What they have been taking until now was all against the military law.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007289	Have you seen the records that are remaining in this city? Didn't they feel somewhat strange...{nl}The Knights of Kaliss are collecting the records which the Royal Army guards have not yet eliminated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007290	I have a request. Please gather the propagandas which the Royal Army guards circulated.{nl}When we compare those with the records that we've gathered, we will find something lacking.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007291	As the defeat of Ruklys became more and more concrete, the Royal Army guards circulated the propagandas more.{nl}There must be some propagandas left in the Petrifying Frost as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007292	They made such embarrassing stories sound like a heroic epic to the ignorant people. {nl}600 years have passed, but they are still embarrassing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007293	You're the one who made me an opportunity.{nl}But, what the hell. I never heard there were so many guards here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007294	I need your help. I need a more powerful bomb.{nl}The frost core that I promised with the Knights of Kaliss is inside the body of Stone Froster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007295	Just do as I told you. {nl}If it's not the bomb, we can't pull out the frost core.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007296	The purity level is not satisfactory.{nl}It could take some time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007297	Since we don't have the fuse, it was made to explode when it gets hit.{nl}I will give you this so I want you to test it on the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007298	If we can't get this done, we can't even start with the next step.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007299	It won't explode right away and explosion is not steady.{nl}What to do..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007300	It should stick to the monster in order to secure the time to explode with a BAM!{nl}Can you get Sticky Liquid from the monsters in Viskas?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007301	I'll say it again but this is the only way to keep you safe.{nl}Hmm? Of course you should throw it. I am busy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007302	I think you spilled some on your way. {nl}Too bad for your new shoes.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007303	You will find a stiff Stone Froster in the residential area. {nl}Throw this to Stone Froster to wake it up. Don't forget to move far after throwing it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007304	When his armor opens up, we should aim for the space.{nl}Don't forget about the frost core.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007305	So this is the frost core that bothered many people.. {nl}The soldiers who helped you will tell the guy watching from the watchtower about your heroic stories so they won't suspect you. Dont' worry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007306	I was worried a lot because it seems there's a big fuss over there.{nl}But, I also had some productive results. Everything will be alright soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007307	If you are going to be near here, please come to me. {nl}I could cast a spell on you to protect you from the Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007308	Good. Let's go to the old market. {nl}When you touch the petrification detector, Sparnashorn will start to attack you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007309	Those Dico Thieves are so smart.{nl}They buy cheap antiques from outside and bury them where the Petrifying Frost blow.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007310	Then they will turn into stones.{nl}The aristocrats in the big cities get deceived by them and they buy them at expensive prices.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007311	There are stones that constantly float down the Vadovo Dock.{nl}It is the record of the rebellion from 600 years ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007312	The records contain the contents that discourage the soldiers so the officers destroyed them from time to time.{nl}But, since we don't have enough workforce, I want you to take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007313	I don't understand how these heavy stuffs float down here and make us dizzy.{nl}I will probably use them when we repair the watchtower.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007314	Whenever the Petrifying Frost blow, the number of soldiers decreases, but the kingdom doesn't possess additional soldiers to support.{nl}That's why we ask the grave robbers or the refugees to join the military.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007315	Only thing I can do is to attach these leaflets around here.{nl}I hope you could help me by thinking that you are supporting the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007316	I'm sure people taking the leaflets but the number of applicants have decreased recently. {nl}Is it because the grave robbers started checking inside. Isn't it suspicious?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007317	When a person like Premier Eminent appears again, I'm sure that the kingdom will flourish quickly.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses that you could be an important person like him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007318	The number of monsters in Kovos Hall Site is increasing. {nl}We don't even know what is leading them here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007319	We don't expect anything from the Royal Army guards who were supposed to help us in the first place.{nl}If you could help us instead, then I will give you the rewards that I promised to give to the soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007320	We've investigated about the incident that was occurring in this city from a long time ago.{nl}We are trying to find hidden facts about the rebellion.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007321	I heard you have lots of battle experiences.{nl}I even want to suggest you to join the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007322	I believe that there is no curse in this world that can't be cured.{nl}With all my faith, I will discover the cure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007323	You're as great as the rumors say. {nl}The Knights of Kaliss need heroes like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007324	This is an interesting place. {nl}This city is filled with things to experiment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007325	Stone debris and dust blow a lot in this area so many soldiers and knights cough severely. {nl}The headquarters send us refreshing candies mixed with medicinal herbs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007326	But our soldiers were swept by the Petrifying Frost while carrying our supplies for this month.{nl}When we found them, the monsters already stole all of them. {nl}Can you get defeat those monsters and get back the refreshing candies?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007327	I would like to give you some if we have extras. {nl}Even the grave robbers are preying on the candies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007328	I won't blame you if you eat one secretly. {nl}But you don't seem to be that kind of a person.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007329	Soldiers patrolling this area were swept by stone frost while passing by Stalactite square some time ago.{nl}We are only affiliated to the Royal Army, but we're mostly residents of Kalis province.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007330	I want to help my folks from back home, but there is no way to get them out of the curse. {nl}We can only get their last will and keepsakes for their families. {nl}Won't you show your kindness for them before they lose their consciousness?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007331	I understand their loyalty for the kingdom, but when I see them make people do impossible things that lead to deaths...{nl}I don't know who is the monster anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007332	In order to restore the city, the Knights of Kaliss hired many experts.{nl}But they just recruit people without any support afterwards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007333	I desperately need your help so that I can keep doing my research.{nl}If we could create a miraculous medicine that would drag out the{nl}controlled spirit, we may be able to find out the source of this curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007334	Besides the knowledge of the spells I possess, I am trying to approach it with various methods.{nl}I will lift this curse for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007335	That's enough ingredients to make the Liberation Elixir. {nl}Now, let's start.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007336	I will give you this Liberation Elixir. Use it on the petrified victims at Vienti Fortress.{nl}Their souls trapped in their body might tell you something about what they last witnessed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007337	The angry souls might attack you.{nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007338	There was nothing to find out about other than the fact that {nl}they were all trembling in panic and fear when they died.{nl}I guess I better look for even older victims.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007339	We can't even find the traces of the bodies of the victims who were sacrificed on the day of Ruklys' rebellion due to Petrifying Frost.{nl}But, that angry souls are deeply permeated into the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007340	Please light the fire at the incense burner that I set at Vienti Fortress with the Knightage.{nl}The angry souls will tell you the story of that day.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007341	Please do not stimulate the angry souls.{nl}Since they are unstable, I don't know how they would react.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007342	The pain, anger... The betrayal and fear...{nl}I can still feel the feelings from that day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007343	But not towards humans. It's as if it is something deep and dark... {nl}I am going back to the knights to find out more about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007344	Even trees or paper turn into stones besides living creatures...{nl}I am very interested in these non-senses. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007345	If you could help me...{nl}Maybe we could save them even if they are cursed with the petrification. Although they may lose their arms.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007346	Even if it works on just one or two from ten of them, that would be great.{nl}I trust on my knowledge and skills.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007347	You weren't able to save any of them? {nl}I guess this is not a good way. I will take back what is left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007348	I think we should use different drugs and test as much as we can. {nl}But then we will need a lot of samples.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007349	Can you defeat the monsters in Neiveikiama Castle and get me petrified samples?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007350	This should be enough for about five tests. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007351	To tell you one more time, the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction so I don't think you would be able to restore it.{nl}If you could come to me fast, then you will save your life even if you lose one of your legs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007352	May those victims rest in peace.{nl}However, like the river that attracts those who are thirsty, this place is astounding for me and my thirst for knowledge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007353	There's a dumb monster that is ruining the beautiful place on the top of Nebekia Fortress.{nl}I want you to take care of him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007354	It if has a brain, how can it go around ruining this? {nl}Oh well, maybe that's why it's a monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007355	Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007356	The Petrifying Frost just swept by so we should get to work quickly.{nl}We can see when and where the Petrifying Frost start by checking whether the soldiers are retreating or not.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007357	And the quickest way to receive the information is to become a Royal Army guard.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007358	I am not sure since I am a low ranking soldier.{nl}This place originally belongs to Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007359	This place belonged to the kingdom, but due to rebellions, 600 years have passed.{nl}Everyone thinks that the Knights of Kaliss will make a movement again soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007360	But, even in this situation, there aren't any conflicts...{nl}The objective of the people who were dispatched here is on the research like Kostas so how would a low rank soldier like me know anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007361	According to what senior officers say, they are not officially belonged to the army, but they are rather somewhat more like mercenaries.{nl}I am not sure, but they asked me about many things on the Petrifying Frost.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007362	Many people from the Knights of Kaliss actually came here to continue on their research besides Kostas.{nl}What would they want from the city of rebel forces... Isn't it strange?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007363	I don't know well since I am a low ranked soldier, but it seems that they don't like each other.{nl}I understand since they are trying to make a move after managing it for 600 years. Who would like it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007364	But, the Knights of Kaliss are saying that it's their fair right and they also said they are going to concentrate on the research so we can't say anything.{nl}What I've heard was to guard them and report their whereabouts... but, then they disappeared again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007365	I've obtained it by paying a large sum to the Royal Army guards so just take a look at it without touching it.{nl}Due to the petrified places, this place turned into a land which no living creatures could live for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007366	But the lives are great. {nl}I predict that the small number of monsters that used to live here became resistant by being exposed to weak Petrifying Frost.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007367	The crystals that grow inside the special monsters could unleash the power that could face against strong Petrifying Frost.{nl}However, the problem is that they get discovered only one in several hundreds or even thousands... That's a pity.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007368	Thanks.{nl}We would be able to lift the curse of the petrification if we could amplify this ethereal power.{nl}Please first get me the reacting stones from the monsters at Palaikai Intersections. I am counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007369	Thanks.{nl}The petrification detectors that are left by the Royal Army guards are scattered across Palaikai Intersections.{nl}Among them, please get me the ones that only react to the symbol of schilt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007370	Ever since I came here, I feel like someone is keep looking at me.{nl}Anyways, see you again after the work is done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007371	When it gets more apparent in the future, then there would an opportunity to show it to you.{nl}We need to collect more documents.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007372	For now, all I can tell you is that some different objective is involved with the rebellion of Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007373	The Royal Army guards forbid anyone in this city from probing into Ruklys.{nl}Anyone who still does that could be treated as a traitor so they educate the soldiers firmly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007374	But as they hide more and more, more people will be curious about Ruklys.{nl}The gallows could be near, but how could a scholar just do nothing?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007375	You are so brave.{nl}According to the records, there are 10 portals in total. Among them, four of them are near here.{nl}Could you find out if they are still activating?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007376	Please get me the hardened gunpowder from the monsters near the watermill ruins.{nl}Let's make special explosives using that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007377	I am going to bring in the thieves in through the central city area. {nl}While you are doing so, if you get encountered by a monster, you will soon get caught by the guards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007378	That's why I want you to act first at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}Unlike Dico Thieves, they pay back to the people they owed to so they will help your journey for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007379	I don't know if you know the relationship between the soldiers and the Knights of Kaliss, but{nl}anyways, the soldiers are looking for something that they can never have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007380	That's why they need the grave robbers. {nl}Of course, it is risky to cooperate with the thieves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007381	Even so, it is very valuable.{nl}And for the future, the relationship with the thieves will be useful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007382	Please use the Berserk powder on the monsters at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}The monsters won't stand at all and go crazy. It will make a quite mess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007383	The information should sometimes be leaked, hid or modified in order to have some values.{nl}We could also make connections with different people by doing so.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007384	People say history is the record of the winners. I think so too.{nl}Have you seen the tombstones that are still remaining on the ruins near Fedimian?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007385	If what the soldiers are spreading is true, then there are many doubts on the records that are remaining here.{nl}And the behaviors of the soldiers that are trying to destroy them are also strange.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007386	Throw this against the monsters.{nl}If you are lucky enough, it will explode with a bang!, but if that's not it, you will make them angry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007387	Please collect the Dark Crystals from the monsters at Vienti Fortress.{nl}I will try to make an elixir that would pull out the controlled spirit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007388	Thanks. First, would you use this melting solution to the monsters that are struggling due to the Petrifying Frost?{nl}I mean Nebekia Fortress. If it's useful, you would be able to use it on the humans as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007389	I personally think the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction.{nl}Which means you can't restore the things that are once petrified before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007390	Even if, Bokor over there tries his best, he won't be able to restore it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007391	But, if the petrification is in progress,{nl}Then I think we may able to save the rest even if we lost the parts that have already become petrified.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007392	Almost all curses will wear off when the one who casted it dies.{nl}That's why I think the curse of the petrification is similar to the one at Pilgrim's Way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007393	But the curse has descended for 600 years.{nl}This means the caster of this curse also has lived for 600 years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007394	But, if we could find out the true identity of the caster, we may push it with stronger power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007395	Kostas doesn't seem to be scared.{nl}Yet I am scared even though I've worked here for a long time. I don't have a clue where he went...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007396	I feel sorry for Gofden who should be waiting for me, but I can't go.{nl}I must continue my research.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007397	No one will call you a coward for running from the Petrifying Frost.{nl}But, if you run away from an important task, you will be held accountable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007398	I am sure there's a way to restore the city that was damaged{nl}due to the rebellion that occurred 600 years ago.{nl}The research on the Petrifying Frost is one of the ways to restore the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007399	I am sure there's a way to lift the curse completely.{nl}Although, it seems that Saliamonas has given up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007400	I am sure there are hidden facts.{nl}Although I don't know what they are.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007401	This city would feel like lost families to the people of Kaliss.{nl}I am sure there's a way to restore the city.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007402	A few of them are mercenaries, but they are also the people of Kaliss.{nl}The way they look at this city will be the same.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007403	The grave robbers are going all out here.{nl}We have to wait for extra support from headquarters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007404	I don't give false hopes to other people.{nl}I just want to find more realistic method.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007405	Were you deceived all this time?{nl}If we rub Velas leaves on the boxes, monsters protect them as if they are something precious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007406	Good. Please get me Velas leaves at the Trade District.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007407	My heart aches to see my colleagues that are just left out there against the elements after succumbing to the Petrifying Frost...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007408	I don't like the Royal Army guards.{nl}They look at us like traitors for what happened 600 years ago.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007409	Now is the time to retrieve our land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007410	We can't clearly see it on the days like today when the stone debris are blowing a lot.{nl}But, when it rains, you can clearly see Ruklys Street.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007411	Disciple Laius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007412	We would be able to find the inheritance of the master if we try little more...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007413	This time, Hones will not stand without handing out the documents.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007414	While I was coming here, I saw the leaflets that encourage people to join the military.{nl}Rip them off all. They are good for sneezing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007415	Since I don't know what the master has in his mind before he passed away, I am worried.{nl}No one would understand my mind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007416	I want to talk to Hones again.{nl}It's been such a long time.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007502	The master always complimented me, but I felt uncomfortable whenever I thought about Hones.{nl}Although, he passed away already... It is good to find out what the master had in his mind.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007503	I feel comfortable now. {nl}I want to talk to Hones.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007504	Very good. You've found the remains of the master's research.{nl}I will let you dispose of them. It is more important for me to continue the will of the master.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007521	But, I can hardly find any evidence.{nl}The spirits hardly talk to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007522	What? The spirits talked to you first?{nl}You must have something which enables you to save them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007523	I have a request for you.{nl}I want you to hear what they are trying to say.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007524	Since there aren't enough evidence, I think we should look for more spirits.{nl}We should also find out why they disappeared without leaving any words.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007525	The reason why the spirits aren't able to talk is due to a contract.{nl}The demons is probably used the Pot of Silence as a Contract of Enunciation.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007527	Be careful though. {nl}It will be very dangerous if it is related to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007528	Perhaps the vanished spirits breached the contract by talking. {nl}I think they wanted to get out by doing so.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007529	It seems that you've destroyed the Pot of Silence safely.{nl}Though, is there any other problem?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007530	It seems that the demons have noticed our movement.{nl} We should resolve this fast before the demons do anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007531	Since the Contract of Enunciation was destroyed, we should be able to listen to the spirits in more details.{nl}It will be good to find the spirits that know the details of the circumstance.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007568	I need a tougher brush. I'm sorry, but could you get me some stiff fur by any chance?{nl}Wait for when the Wendigo Archers faint after hitting them with this dart.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007569	Until then, I will be looking around the other tablets.{nl}Alright then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007570	Nice, we're both back just in time.{nl}Give those to me. I can easily make a brush out of it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007571	I'm not sure if you've noticed, but these tablets record forecasts of the future.{nl}This place used to be a training ground for Oracles a long time ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007572	I am doing research on the forecasts that are still remaining here.{nl}I need an assistant. What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007573	Good. You will also get valuable information and experience out of this.{nl}Okay, shall we get started?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007574	This was the training field of the Oracles in the past.{nl}I am looking for abandoned forecasts here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007575	When you pull the levers in order, the tombstones may react.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007576	You seem to have some other request for me.{nl}How can I help you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007577	Eitbaras... he...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007578	Thank you for telling me this precious story.{nl}But, we cannot tell you what we know about the story as of yet.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007583	I still remember a time when they were peaceful.{nl}But, those days are long gone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007584	Those very beings now hold strong ambitions and war with no end in sight...{nl}Even a fairy like me could not pretend to not see this.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007585	As the discord of these great beings began to envelop the world, I too became curious to why they conflicted with each other.{nl}Perhaps, now is the time the humans can begin living independent lives.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007586	Ausrine refrained from answering my questions about the conflict.{nl}She instead asked me to pray for good luck for the humans taking shelter in their homes.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007587	Giltine also didn't give an answer.{nl}As usual, she did not support the role Ausrine suggested to me.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007588	But there is fortune and misfortune in luck, and my mission is to manage both sides.{nl}I hold those words true to my heart and use them as a guiding principle in my work.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007589	Since then, I've spent countless hours performing my new role.{nl}However, my duties didn't give an answer to my questions.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007590	That's why I went to see Giltine.{nl}After listening to my repetitive questions, she finally opened her mouth after a long silence.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007591	I am not going to give you the answer.{nl}But, I can give you the power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007592	The power that may lead you to the answer that you are seeking.{nl}Even if you never get the answer, you will be satisfied with your new changes.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007595	Archeologist Justas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007596	I am so lucky. The goddesses helped me this time as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007597	Ah, I am Justas. I am excavating the records of Demetrius who is the historian from the ancient period.{nl}What has brought you here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007598	Is that so... Revelator... Then you would like my research.{nl}Actually, I needed someone who would be my guard and assistant. Are you interested?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007599	This place are the ruins before the construction of the kingdom.{nl}But, I am not that interested in here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007600	What I really want are the records of Demetrius.{nl}It is unique that it is recorded on a Metal Plate...It seems to contain an amazing story.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007601	Maybe we would be able to find out where we came from.{nl}Then we may be able to find out what would happen to us as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007602	Good. Good. I will give you the task of obtaining the bone pieces of Hallowventer curse speller.{nl}They are the best materials to use when you make an antirust agent.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007603	It is so fortunate to have a good assistant.{nl}The goddesses helped me on this as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007604	There's a saying that geniuses are freaks. How should the people of the later generations do if the Metal Plate gets rusted.{nl}Anyways, the work is being done quickly because of you so I feel happy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007605	I want to request to you to bring the Metal Plate on Ramive Hills.{nl}There are many plates that I could not bring due to the monsters. You can do it right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007606	This place is too isolated so the monsters rush in.{nl}Be careful all the time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007607	Good!{nl}But, the status is too bad so it would take a long time...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007608	What a view, don't you think?{nl}Though there are grander things hidden here, such as the records of historian Demetrius.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007609	I am looking for the records of Demetrius that haven't been discovered yet.{nl}The monsters are dangerous, but I have a good feeling.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007610	Alruida is near Apsba Hall.{nl}We've been working together for a long time so even if we are far apart, we know each other well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007611	Isn't it great to hear that humans, goddesses and demons may lived together for a long time?{nl}But, then how come there are no records remaining?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007612	That is so shocking.{nl}A great scholar like Demetrius could had not recorded lies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007613	Since we haven't found everything, we can't say this for sure, but...{nl}I think it's about where humans came from.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007614	Archeologist Alruida
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007615	Are you also interested in historian Demetrius?{nl}Or are you just a traveler?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007616	There was a progress in the research because of you.{nl}Now we should find out if his records are fictitious or real.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007617	If his records are real, it will make many people shock.{nl}But, personally, I don't want to believe it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007618	I am chasing after the Metal Plate that is engraved with the records of Demetrius.{nl}I am keep getting interrupted by the monsters, but we have some results though.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007622	The spirits don't say anything to me.{nl}Have you heard any stories of them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007623	The only thing I could do was to depress for hundreds of years.{nl}I want to just disappear if I can.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007624	What can I do after losing the master and the body.{nl}Besides just watching the demons...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007625	I can't neither go beside the goddesses nor be eliminated.{nl}For what... I am doing... such...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007635	A method to restore a destroyed tombstone at the Namu Temple Ruins?{nl}Since you come to my shop often, I can help you with that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007636	The sticky resin from Green Roftlems is widely used as stone adhesives.{nl}However, you can't find them through normal means in the Namu Temple Ruins.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007637	So, here's a bait box.{nl}They go crazy on the smell of the food inside. They will be lured to that smell.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007638	When you find the sticky resin, please mix it with this coagulant before using it.{nl}Stones will be easily attached.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007639	It will be easier to make perfume from a Kepa than to find it without using a bait box.{nl}Even going to Laukyme Swamp would be less of a hassle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007640	Ah. It definitely reacted this time.{nl}I would have spent a long time without your help. Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007641	Thanks for helping us.{nl}The goddess helps the ones who try their best, and I think it was you, the Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007642	Many demons are gathering at Rituala to participate in a magic ritual that frees Blut.{nl}Please, first defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007643	Valtruss is defeated but his servants are still left in Oruarma Cathedral. {nl}I want you to make those demons pay for their sins.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007644	Even if you are the Revelator, you better not fool around. {nl}The corruption here is not something for you to mind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007645	I wish you good luck in the name of the goddess.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007647	The dimensional crack.. We cannot close it without Dionys.{nl}Please find Dionys until I recover my power..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007648	My mission is to retrieve the relics, but I can't stand and watch this anymore.{nl}Can you defeat the monsters that are roaming around the Great Cathedral?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007649	If this Great Cathedral gets purified, all credit would go to you.{nl}But, we still have a long way to go.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007650	I believe that my research will be helpful in tough times like nowadays.{nl}Of course, we should first find helpful forecasts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007651	I am sure it contains a breakthrough idea.{nl}What did the Oracle see...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007652	Dead of the dead... what could that mean.{nl}Do you have any idea?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007653	Amanda
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007654	Let's see
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007655	Day by day
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007656	The monsters ruined the apiary and the brewery.{nl}So Joseph went to Klaipeda to look for Revelators who could help us. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007657	I thought they would've solved the problem, but guess what happened.{nl}They started disappearing one by one. They backed out. Those cowards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007658	If you think you are ready, I will show you the true origin of the curse.{nl}If you can't eliminate it at once, it will cause bigger trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007659	But, there is still a way.{nl}If you could help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007660	If it's okay with you, can you check the reagent's effects?{nl}Ah, I didn't mean trying it on yourself. I meant trying it on the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007661	It's done. {nl}I hope it works.. Can you give this meat to the pilgrim down below?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007662	You must feed him until he's satisfied.{nl}Here's all the meat that you got. 15 pieces, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007663	Are peaceful days going to return, just like the good old times?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007664	I want to bury Dallas at Taika Cliff, where he can see his hometown.{nl}But there are so many monsters there. Please get rid of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007665	Aren't you the Revelator?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007666	Ah, it's great that you're here.{nl}You must have traveled to various places in the kingdom.{nl}I am sorry, but do you know anything about this mysterious girl?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007667	The girl left this tree before Medzio Diena.{nl}My master asked me to find out more about the tree, but I know nothing about it... I want to get help from you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007668	This farm's owner is Gina Greene.{nl}She kindly lent this farm to people like us who lost land since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007669	Hey you. Revelator. Don't just look at me. Help me.{nl}Please drive out the Lizardmen on my fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007670	You must know that there's a food shortage in the kingdom right now.{nl}If you are okay with it, can you help me with my investigation?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007671	I really appreciate it.{nl}First, collect Rambear Fur from the Rambear Archers nearby. I need to check something.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007672	If that's the case, please eliminate all the Stumpy Trees.{nl}Oh, and don't forget to bring evidence as well. I need something to report with.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007673	Even if you are the Revelator, this is a private land. {nl}Get out if you don't have any business here!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007674	We have a big problem!{nl}The spoiled grape vines dried to their deaths, but now monsters are attracted to them.{nl}What can I do?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007675	Investigate the bushes near the grape vines, hidden monsters may suddenly appear.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007676	Sometimes, more monsters will appear when you shake the bushes.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007677	I paid a lot for this at the black market in Fedimian.{nl}Perhaps, this will be much more helpful than you or that shameless druid.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007678	This is sturdy. You've been suffered by the trap of Ebonypawn.{nl}But, what have brought you here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007679	You are the Revelator? It's so nice to meet you.{nl}Thanks for saving me... I have another request for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007680	We are doing an important mission at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007681	This is a little complicated.{nl}We are chasing after Ebonypawn who is the suspect of the murder case at the Astral Tower.{nl}But, he is being protected by these religious rules at the monastery nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007682	So, please help us to get Ebonypawn.{nl}We should somehow first persuade the monks.. Though, that's going to be tricky.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007683	I am so sorry. {nl}Please first persuade Potos at Diliti Court.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007684	The monks shake their heads in denial when we mention Ebonypawn...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007685	Do you know of the Astral Tower?{nl}Starting with Lydia Schaffen, the greatest archers are all originated from that place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007686	The head of the Astral Tower was killed by Ebonypawn.{nl}I've chased him up till here, but I'm having trouble of doing anything further,{nl}because of the religious rules of the sanctuary{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007687	The monastery protect the ones who are falsely charged.{nl}I thought that the law was ineffective after Medzio Diena.. I want to resolve this without creating a conflict.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007688	Hello. Traveler.{nl}What has brought you here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007689	If you are here to discuss about the Hunters, I am sorry, but I'll pass.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007690	The monastery is full of monsters and we should first{nl}cure the monks who have been hit by the paralysis poison.{nl}Now is not the time to be involved in such a complicated matter.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007691	The Hunters... They must know how to detoxify.{nl}These are the needles that we've gotten from our brothers. I am sorry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007692	If our brothers help, I am willing to help you as well.{nl}I have a lot on my mind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007693	This... All right. It's pretty obvious who did this.{nl}Well, first give them this antidote. Fortunately, the poison is not that severe.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007694	I am embarrassed to see the faces of the Hunters... I am sorry.{nl}We also have to consider our position of the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007695	But, if the poison is really from Ebonypawn, then the story will be different.{nl}I am sorry, but I want to see the trap myself.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007696	Recently, monsters have rushed into the monastery.{nl}It was very quick and the monsters went crazy in the monastery as if they were possessed by something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007697	We had no other choice but to run away.{nl}The problem was abbot. He was praying in the Prayer Room.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007698	Fortunately, the Prayer Room is the safest place in the monastery.{nl}We know that even monsters can't do anything there, but we couldn't just do nothing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007699	So, there is not enough evidence, huh?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007700	Reina, a subordinate of mine, is looking for the traces of Ebonypawn down there.{nl}Recently, she found something, but it seems she's having difficulty.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007701	It looks like your task is going smoothly.{nl}You know, I've received rewards that are bigger than my life in value.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007702	Hey, don't walk around recklessly, it's dangerous here.{nl}I recommend you to move out from this forest while you can.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007703	Hello. Traveler.{nl}What has brought you here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007704	What? The captain sent you to me? Excuse me, I'm sorry.{nl}There is a working trap, but it's not easy to get it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007705	I kind of have a problem here, I cannot move.{nl}I've been caught by the trap. I'm such an idiot... I've quickly detoxified myself, but it still hurts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007706	I will lend you my Jareth.{nl}He makes many mistakes because of his old age, but please understand that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007707	I guess I am not competent enough yet.{nl}I wanted to become like the Hunter Captain... I guess I still have a long way to go.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007708	Let's take a look at this... This has been made with some skill that I have seen often. {nl}The captain is looking for a working trap, right? Please bring him this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007709	As your competence increases, people won't know who made these traps.{nl}On the contrary, people may find out who made these traps so easily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007710	Besides, the difficulty lowers by a lot if there's only one suspect like in this case.{nl}We just have to find his characteristics.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007711	As I expected, that is indeed from Ebonypawn. {nl}I can hardly find any trace of him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007712	But, the traps are easily made with the materials nearby. {nl}We just have to hope that the monk notices it. First, take it and show it to him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007713	After you have persuaded the monk, please meet Natasha at Viltis Forest.{nl}I've gotten word that she's at a loss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007714	Look at this. This is the silk that was used in this trap... I believe I've seen it before.{nl}If someone got his hands on the supplies of the monastery, we can think of only one person.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007715	Good.{nl}After retrieving the monastery, I will tell the abbot about this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007716	The captain sent you here?{nl}It's about time that reliable support came to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007717	You will have to persuade the other brothers besides me.{nl}There is a place nearby called Viltis Forest. Senior Monk Marko can be found there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007718	Something big happened at the monastery.{nl}Would you be able to help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007719	I think I've lost my precious scripture while I was running away.{nl}But, I also have to take care of our brothers.. Can you look for them? I don't care if you only find the pages.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007720	If you can't find them, then we would have to accept it.{nl}People's lives are more important than the pages of the scripture.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007721	So they are ripped off..{nl}I guess we have no other choice. Please, let's first concentrate on curing my brothers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007722	It's the worst case scenario.{nl}The forest is covered with thorns and there are traps everywhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007723	And my brothers are suffering because of the poison.{nl}If the threat of the monsters lowers down, I would be relaxed enough to finish the cure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007724	Who made all these traps?{nl}I don't feel very well seeing my brothers suffer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007725	Thank you so much.{nl}I will now pray for our brothers for a full recovery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007726	Since I quickly ran away from the monastery, I wasn't able to bring many things with me.{nl}I should somehow feed some nutritious food to our brothers who are suffering from the poison..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007727	Thank you so much.{nl}There is a mushroom called Tempas. It grows really fast.{nl}Please get me some of those from Juklas Sunny Place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007728	You will find it when you walk diligently.{nl}They are usually hidden in the ground.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007729	Thanks.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses that they will be okay after eating this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007730	Since I am not feeling well right now, I do want to prepare in advance.{nl}If you are going to hunt for monsters nearby, could you please listen to my request?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007731	Please collect the stone legs of the Rocktors.{nl}I can use those for my arrowheads.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007732	The stone legs of Roctors near this are usable.{nl}Other things are somewhat soft.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007733	This many.. Thank you so much.{nl}It will be good if we return to the place where the captain is, but we should first finish our mission.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007734	I think the monsters found out that I have suffered from the poison.{nl}They are slowly narrowing the gap. This could be dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007735	Let's use Jareth.{nl}Even if you stand in front, they may rush in when you leave.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007736	Please hunt for the monsters with Jareth.{nl}After they engage in combat, the monsters will be scared if Jareth unleashes its smell.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007737	Jareth is old, but very brave.{nl}Sometimes he has the tendency to attack first because of his bravery...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007738	Did Jareth do well?{nl}Now we can worry less about the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007739	We should retrieve the monastery.{nl}If we don't move fast, the abbot will be in danger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007740	The abbot here is called Marko and he leads the monastery here.{nl}But, he is too stubborn. He is too difficult.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007741	I will support here with all I could so I hope you pass my position.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007742	I should've persuaded him slowly, but I think we were in a rush.{nl}But, it was that important...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007743	You are a different person. Even so, no is no.{nl}They are very rude. They know the circumstances well, and Ebonypawn...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007744	And the abbot is locked in the monastery.{nl}Unless we retrieve the monastery, do not mention about the deportation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007745	If retrieving monastery is more important, that's good.{nl}If they approve, we will support with everything we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007746	You should first help those monks.{nl}They should have more than one person in trouble. You should do favors for them first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007747	Hunters will step up first. They should have done that in the first place.{nl}Then, I have something to request to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007748	We were preparing to retrieve the monastery ourselves.{nl}Please let our brothers down there know that Hunters are helping.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007749	I shall wait for Boros. I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007750	Do not think bad about us.{nl}We should first retrieve the monastery, but they are only talking about Ebonypawn so we don't feel comfortable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007751	We have a problem. {nl}One of the monks have been suffering to the poison of Ebonypawn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007752	He is breathing, but he is becoming stiff.{nl}What should we do about this...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007753	This place is dangerous.{nl}Be cautious at all times.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007754	We've passed the dangerous situation with an emergency procedure, but...{nl}If we don't detoxify it completely, there will be more crises.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007755	This is the first time I'm seeing this kind of combination of poison.{nl}I'm going to check on him, while I do that, please get me the other poison.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007756	If I'm right, then the poison can be acquired from the thorns of a Chafperor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007757	The poison must have been made using material that can be found around this area. {nl}Please hurry, before it's too late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007758	It is so fortunate that we discovered it before it was too late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007759	You are not too late.{nl}I hope one of these three poisons will work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007760	We were planning to search for a Wugushi in the city, but fortunately it seems that we don't need to do that.{nl}I think I will be able to make an antidote if we have the leaves from Woodluwa.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007761	I was worried that we may have to move to another city.{nl}If we have to look for a Wugushi there, then we can't guarantee our lives.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007762	I'll absorb the poison with this.{nl}I am going to keep looking over him so please care of Marko, he seems uneasy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007763	You won't understand how embarassed and painful I am.{nl}My brother almost died due to the poison and I received help from the Hunters that I kicked out...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007764	Good. You would have to persuade Goss at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Please tell Marko that I've decided to go with Hunters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007765	Fortunately, it turned out alright.{nl}Please meet Captain Mintz on your way to Laukyme Swamp and tell him that everything went alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007766	Senior monk Goss is leading the brothers at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If Ebonypawn did all of these, the goddesses would also understand my rage.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007767	It's so nice seeing you.{nl}So how did the task at Viltis Forest go?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007768	Go first.{nl}I will follow you to Laukyme Swamp if he gets there alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007769	So that's it. We now have to persuade one of the monks and retrieve the monastery...{nl}After that, we would be able to contact with the abbot who would decide what to do with Ebonypawn.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007770	I will gather the Hunters.{nl}Please continue to help Natasha at Laukyme Swamp.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007771	When you go up the Ershike Path, you will reach Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If you fail to persuade them, then we would have to retrieve the monastery ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007772	You've come a long way.{nl}So I heard a monk named Goss is taking the place of the abbot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007773	Strange... a traveler in this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007774	It's so shameful as a hunter...{nl}After finding the traces of Ebonypawn, I was really delighted, but I found out that was a trap...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007775	I am sorry, but can you look for the grass that he is looking for?{nl}I can only move one of my arms and my neck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007776	It's so fortunate that you came before the monsters.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007777	Good. Good. {nl}We should first survive before feeling embarassed. Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007778	We have lots of things to prepare.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007779	You are not... one of those Hunters.{nl}Since I can't trust them, I have a request for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007780	I want to make an ointment for the wounded brothers.{nl}Can you make beehives with the blessing from the goddesses?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007781	It took so little time for monsters to sweep across the monastery.{nl}I think I was lucky enough to be alive with the blessing from the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007782	You've tried hard, but... we were making beeswax, but strangely, it doesn't become clear at all.{nl}What should we do about this...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007783	That's it. I am sorry, but can you help me with one more thing?{nl}If I only have the resin that is collected in the head of Woodluwa I think I will be able to resolve it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007784	I didn't expect I would meet someone other than those Hunters.{nl}I am sure the goddesses haven't abandoned me yet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007785	I wasn't able to do anything myself, but it is so fortunate that the goddesses have sent you.{nl}I will make some medicine. Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007786	Stranger...{nl}If you don't have any task here, please go back.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007787	The monastery is locked with the barriers of the monks so it won't be possible without the persuasion from Goss.{nl}But, I... it's too difficult.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007788	Hunters... they just won't give up.{nl}I've heard Marko and Potos are with the Hunters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007789	But, you should be cautious.{nl}We just can't listen to one side.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007790	After persuading him, we can immediately start to retrieve the monastery.{nl}We can expect to expel Ebonypawn then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007791	Without Goss, we won't be able to recover the monastery.{nl}I hope you succeed in persuading him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007792	But, I think we can resume the talk after retrieving the monastery.{nl}Please show me the competence which I could rely on so I can cooperate with you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007793	Good.{nl}The Liverworts and Stonacons around here would be enough. Please also bring the proofs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007794	You can give up if you feel that's too much for you.{nl}We were gonna finish it ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007795	You definitely possess the competence. We also have the same objective.{nl}There is no reason to insist anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007796	The senior monk here is very picky.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007797	I will gather the monks in front of the entrance of the monastery, so tell the Hunters to gather as well.{nl}After they are here, we will unleash the seals to block any monsters from following us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007798	But, although we retrieved the monastery, don't expect us to expel Ebonypawn.{nl}The abbot will decide everything after he comes out from the Prayer Room.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007799	Please understand that we could only do this.{nl}We've only listened to your story.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007800	What Goss said also makes sense.{nl}As they gather in front of the monastery, we should have some {nl}decisive evidence that would withdraw Ebonypawn's declaration.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007801	I think we would have enough time.{nl}I am sorry, but please go back to Goss and ask him {nl}what happened when Ebonypawn was coming.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007802	You can't prove that he was a cruel assassin.{nl}We can't release the ones that are being protected in the sanctuary by just guessing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007803	What they said about the traps and the monsters {nl}that conquered the monastery are also the same.{nl}It's only a one-sided story that this was done by Ebonypawn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007804	We are the people who pray for the generosity of the goddesses.{nl}So to withdraw the protection of Ebonypawn, you should show them some decisive evidence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007805	Hmm. I remember that clearly.{nl}One day, someone named Ebonypawn knocked on the door of the monastery. {nl}With his wounded body...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007806	After bringing him inside, I began to cure him.{nl}He also requested to protect the sanctuary at our monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007807	That's right. Before he came on that day, one man {nl}who seemed to be affected by the poison also came.{nl}He was very ill, and eventually passed away before I could even ask him a question.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007808	His grave is in Priekis Rest Area. With his keepsakes.{nl}Ah, Ebonypawn also asked me whether there was someone who came before him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007809	The man affected by the poison... I am sure he ran away from Ebonypawn.{nl}But why did he run away from Ebonypawn...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007810	There weren't any other things besides that.{nl}Did this help you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007811	It's not good for the deceased, but I think I should look for his keepsakes from his grave.{nl}I need to find out why Ebonypawn was chasing after him. Please, you have to help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007812	Did you find anything?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007813	This is the directory of the Schaffenstar.{nl}There's a letter in the middle of it... This is the seal of the Schaffenstar. Let's rip it off.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007814	This is the request letter for murder and the confirmation of the receipt. {nl}The receiver is Ebonypawn...{nl}I think Ebonypawn thought this letter would be at the monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007815	I am sure that Ebonypawn caused the mess of the monsters to look for this. {nl}It was easy for him to do this. This is decisive evidence. Let's show it to Goss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007816	A murder request... This is the evidence we need.{nl}The abbot would think differently of him when he sees this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007817	All the other monks are ready and went in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's go. I will see you in front of the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007818	Everything is clear now.{nl}I will go to the entrance of the monastery first. Let's join there together.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007819	You've came?{nl}We are ready to enter the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007820	Everyone seems to be gathering in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007821	I thought it was a manner not to touch it since it was his last keepsake.{nl}How would anyone have thought it would turn out like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007822	Everyone knows that the Hunter Master and the Ranger Master are chasing after Ebonypawn.{nl}But, the reason why no one could step forward is because they didn't have any decisive evidence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007823	Now, this is different. This letter is evidence.{nl}Since we have the seal of the Schaffenstar, we don't have to worry about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007824	This place is dangerous... I miss the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007825	I want to be safe until I go back to the monastery.{nl}But the monsters near here are very threatening.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007826	There will be lots of monsters if we move out a bit from the hills.{nl}I'll be counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007827	Now, I can relax until I go back to the monastery.{nl}Thank you so much. I hope the goddesses bless you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007828	We don't have enough water to drink here. It is strange since this place is full of water.{nl}After this place turned into a thorny forest, we can't drink it without purifying it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007829	If we have Asilado water plant, we can purify it with that.{nl}But, I am too scared of the monsters... Can you obtain some of them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007830	We would last for a while even if there's no food, but not without drinkable water.{nl}I hope you would help us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007831	Wow. You've collected a lot.{nl}Thank you so much. We will use these water plants well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007832	We need help due to the monsters!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007833	I didn't expect someone to come to this dangerous place...{nl}I am observing the movements of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007834	Everyone will gather here after we are done. {nl}Just in case they may lose their strength due to the monsters,{nl}before we begin retrieving the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007835	There are more dangerous monsters inside the monastery.{nl}We don't have a chance if we lose all our energies here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007836	Thank you.{nl}But, I am worried since there are still many monsters left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007837	Are you trying to help me more?{nl}If that's so, it will be really appreciated...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007838	We've cleaned up many monsters. {nl}One more thing... I want you to do the last task.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007839	Thanks for your efforts.{nl}When the monks ask me, I will tell them to pray to the goddesses to protect you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007840	When you go into the monastery, let's first secure the entrance of Prayer Room.{nl}I will leave when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007841	We've recovered the hall. Let's continue on without taking a rest.{nl}Mintz... please take the rear since the monsters may follow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007842	It doesn't look easy from here.{nl}There are many monsters in the hallway so let's be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007843	We ended up like this while moving fast to save the abbot...{nl}We will move again after we get some rest so please go first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007844	The old body of me can't endure as I unlocked two barriers consecutively.{nl}Shall we go to Prayer Room now?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007845	It is so fortunate to see you are okay. {nl}Now, we should move the abbot out.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007846	We barely saved the abbot.{nl}Thanks for your efforts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007847	The oratory can only be opened through the orb by Holy Power.{nl}Moheim is responsible of caring for the orb. I reckon he's somewhere near the palor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007848	It is impossible to open the oratory without the orb unless someone opens it from the inside.{nl}There is no way for the director to know about this fuss outside either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007849	Are you talking about the crystal sphere?{nl}I can't move it out at all so I hid it inside the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007850	It's so good to recover the monastery, but when are we going to finish cleaning it...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007851	It was a really important object so I put it in the box first.{nl}Inside the reception room. If you find it, please take it to Goss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007852	I have to protect this place so I can't go with you.{nl}There aren't many boxes so you will find it easily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007853	Yes. That's the crystal sphere.{nl}Please bring it to Goss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007854	Abbot
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007855	Thanks for resolving the crisis.{nl}I can feel the goddesses are protecting you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007856	So you've come. Soon, the abbot would come out.{nl}Please wait a bit here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007857	Why is the monastery like this and why are you all gathered here?{nl}And you... you seem to have some business with me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007858	He is the abbot of the Tyla Monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007859	We barely managed to come this far so I am hoping for good results.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007860	So you are asking me to withdraw my declaration to protect Ebonypawn.{nl}You came this far to do that...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007861	Okay. I will discuss this with the senior monks.{nl}Can you wait until then?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007862	I will wait for their decision here first.{nl}If their declaration doesn't get withdrawn, then I should think about what to do at then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007863	So it seems that their discussion is over.{nl}Let's go there and listen to their conclusion.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007864	We haven't finished our discussion.{nl}Please wait with the Hunters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007865	After we've discussed with the senior monks...{nl}We've decided to withdraw our declaration to protect Ebonypawn.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007866	From this point on, Ebonypawn won't be protected by Tyla Monastery and we request Ebonypawn to leave at once.{nl}Also, we are not going to be involved with others' decision to punish him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007867	I hope the goddessess will be with you on your rest of journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007868	Besides from the expulsion, we can't forgive his actions that ruined the monastery.{nl}We should find him since he should be here somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007869	He made the monastery like this due to that letter. {nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007870	He is so cunning..{nl}The Hunters are surrounding this place so he will get caught within a short period of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007871	We would have had hard time without your help.{nl}Thank you so much for your efforts. I pray that the goddesses be with you on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007872	If it wasn't for your help, the circumstances would have not been like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007873	I've read it from the book before. {nl}Some smell has the power to pull the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007874	I should've noticed when Ebonypawn brought that lump... I didn't expect that would be enlarged this big...{nl}We are eliminating them as we see them, but I want you to help us as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007875	We are luring the monsters with the smell so it won't be effective if you just destroy them.{nl}Please destroy the lumps using this liquid medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007876	When I saw it, it was about the size of my palm so I don't understand how it got that big.{nl}This is all my fault...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007878	We were able to retrieve the monastery, but as you can see there are still full of monsters.{nl}Could you help us little more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007879	Orange Kowaks inside the monastery are most problematic.{nl}They are the most violent and vicious monsters among the monsters that came into the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007880	They are still inside.{nl}Please eliminate the monsters including them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007881	The number of monsters won't increase from this point on.{nl}But, in order to eliminate them completely, we would need lots of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007882	The goddesses helped us to retrieve the monastery.{nl}Lots of other sacred places are still occupied by many monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007883	It's a mess. {nl}The monsters are sweeping across the monastery so the books are all scattered.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007884	When would we able to gather all these books again and divide them into different categories...{nl}If you pick up scriptures, please bring them to me.

QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009205	Well, shall we take a look around Monocle?{nl}If you can see something special, there must be something important there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009206	Can you bring more of these old bombs?{nl}I am not trying to use them for malicious purposes. I just want to do some research.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009207	I will give you the tools to dismantle the bomb.{nl}If you break the detonator with those, you can bring the bombs safely.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009211	By the way, why did you come here?{nl}Since you don't say anything about it, this must be important right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009212	Anyway, let's go deeper inside.{nl}You should tell me later. Okay?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009213	The demons didn't have special objects.{nl}What... you don't have them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009214	Revelator. {nl}After Medzio Diena, Vakarine's power has become weak, so we have to protect her.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009215	This is not the world of the humans nor the world of demons, but another space of Vakarine...{nl}We have imprisoned the demons inside this prison who are evil to the world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009216	However, after Medzio Diena, Vakarine didn't have the power left to maintain this space.{nl}As you can see, this space is gradually collapsing and the dimensional crack is getting wider.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009217	The Demon Lords who are locked in this prison are trying to escape here.{nl}Other demons who came here through the dimensional crack are joining them as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009218	Vakarine desperately needs your help.{nl}Please help us with your strength to defeat the demons at this prison.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009219	Please first stop the demons that are trying to release the Demon Lord Blut that is locked here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009220	Demon Lord Blut's servants are trying to help him escape here. {nl}Hauberk's help will be useful this time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009221	Right now, Kupole Zydrone is holding down Blut. {nl}But since Vakarine's power has waned after Medzio Diena, we are not like what we were before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009222	Fortunately, Blut hasn't been completely freed yet...{nl}However, we don't know how much longer we can endure by ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009223	We have to somehow weaken the power of the Demon Lord Blut.{nl}I am sure his allies set the camp near Bjaurer Hideout.{nl}Please get the mark of Blut that they hold.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009224	Our original duty was to supervise and manage the prison.{nl}But... now, we are trying our best to just hold back the demons. {nl}No matter what it takes.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009225	So you are the one who Vakarine talked about.{nl}Well done. Everything will be done with goddess' will.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009226	We've locked Blut across this barrier.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009227	No demon besides Blut knows more about Vakarine's weakening than we do.{nl}Blut is not completely freed yet, so we now have an opportunity to get rid of him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009228	But, if we don't defeat Blut quickly, this barrier will collapse soon.{nl}Let's defeat him at once. Are you ready?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009229	We were able to defeat Blut because of you.{nl}You brought us hope.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009230	As you know, Vakarine's power is... really weak at the moment.{nl}If we had not defeated Blut here, we might not have been able to continue protecting Vakarine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009231	Alright. Please go to the 2nd District of the Prison.{nl}To defeat the next Demon Lord, I am sure Kupole Arune has prepared something.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009232	The demons that lost Blut are causing a rampage. {nl}If they escape to the outside world, it will be a great disaster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009233	The barrier is gradually collapsing.{nl}I don't know what would happen even if we defeated the demons...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009234	Good work. {nl}It's a relief that those demons did not notice the weakening of the crack to the outside world.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009235	Human exploration teams came in from the outside world in the past. {nl}Unfortunately, they all died before we could do anything. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009236	Humans should not ever come here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009237	So you are the Revelator Vakarine talked about. {nl}It is great that you aren't late.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009238	The Demon Lord Nuaele's power is weakening the prison at an alarming rate.{nl}However, we Kupoles have no way to stop Nuaele now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009239	Also, Kupole Aldona told me that she couldn't just wait for the Revelator...{nl}Without the time for persuasion, she went after Nuaele.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009240	Please stop the demons that are coming here through the dimensional crack.{nl}If you could stop them before they join Nuaele, it will be great help to the safety of Aldona.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009241	Goddess.{nl}I hope nothing has happened to Aldona...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009242	With her forces diminished, Nuaele's power should be weakened.{nl}Before anything happens to Aldona, I will tell you what to do next.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009243	Nuaele is difficult to face head-on with only us.{nl}But Nuaele wasn't always that strong.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009244	Nuaele became stronger only after obtaining the pieces of Hauberk's seal. {nl}Hauberk's servants who lost their master started to follow her since she had the pieces of the seal{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009245	Since then, Nuales started wielding her new mighty power,{nl}To Hauberk, she is like a traitor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009246	Knowing that, there should be a way to increase Hauberk's power.{nl} It's not a bad idea from Hauberk's point-of-view either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009247	Please go to the 2nd Isolation Area. {nl}I am sure Hauberk's former servants are gathered there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009248	I am sure the Demon Lord Nuaele is aware of this now.{nl}That the power of the others is not hers to keep.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009249	Hmm... there's something that's been bugging me.{nl} When Nuaele collected power, she could've tried escaping immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009250	But, it seems that Nuaele is waiting for something.{nl}We should find out what she is planning.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009251	Please interrogate the servants of Nuaele.{nl}Since Hauberk is also a demon, it will be easy to read their minds.{nl}It becomes even easier when they are in their spirit form.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009252	It seems she's planned to make this prison her world from the beginning. {nl}If her plans succeed, even if Goddess Vakarine powers were restored, it would not be enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009253	Now, please meet with Aldona. {nl}She will take you to Nuaele's territory.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009254	Goddess Vakarine is waiting for you at the District 3.{nl}But, I feel somewhat uneasy since she is so stubborn.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009255	In the past, she told us that she couldn't just not do anything, even if her power was weakened.{nl}We barely managed to persuade her.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009256	To prevent something from happening to Vakarine, please move to the District 3 as quickly as possible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009257	The dimensional crack and the Demon Lords... they were inevitable.{nl}I could feel my power becoming weaker after Medzio Diena and I had to find some way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009258	I have given my Dionys great power that should not be stolen by the Demon Lord.{nl}But, that power was so strong, it started to control Dionys...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009259	I cannot tell you details about that power at this moment.{nl}But, please just know that this power that is controlling Dionys is the only way to close the dimensional crack.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009260	Please complete the Evening Star Key with Kupole Zydrone.{nl}With the Evening Star Key, Dionys could regain his control back over that power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009261	Savior!{nl}I have been waiting for you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009262	The strong power controlling Dionys' ego was to never fall into the hands of the demons.{nl}Not to mention Dionys is like a powerful guardian to Vakarine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009263	But, it was important to stop the demons...{nl}She had no choice, but to make a heart-aching decision.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009264	We have decided to seal Dionys and its power until the prison regains stability...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009265	We don't know what that power is exactly.{nl}But, we know that it can be used to close the dimensional crack and should not be taken away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009266	Fortunately, we could detach that power if we put holy power into the Evening Star Key.{nl}Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009267	Dionys is the guardian whom Vakarine most adores.{nl}She reluctantly sealed the strong power to Dionys and fell into the deep sadness...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009268	Now go to Oruarma Cathedral. {nl}Protect me from the demons while I focus the goddess' power into the Evening Star Key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009269	Here. Please give this key to Kupole Aldona. {nl}She must be holding down Dionys now. Please hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009270	You are not too late!{nl}Let's release the power of the Evening Star Key.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009271	When you unleash the seal, the power that is held in the key will be collected to this magic suppressor.{nl}I want you to release the seals at Rearda, Kasa, and Rada.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009272	Dionys is not someone we can face against.{nl}Even Vakarine in her old days would not be able to do anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009273	The power of the Evening Star Key is accumulating in the magic suppressor.{nl}We are all ready and there's plenty of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009274	We are going to detach the power from Dionys now.{nl}If we fail, it would be as if tens of Demon Lords were let loose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009275	As such, we need to approach this with caution. {nl}Let me know when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009276	Hauberk fled towards District 4, which is under Daiva's watch. {nl}First, you should return to Vakarine. I will look for Dionys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009277	Savior. {nl}The time has come for you to know the truth.{nl}The power which I gave to Dionys is called the Chain of Reversion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009278	The Chain of Reversion is the wonder that connects every boundary of anything...{nl}Hauberk probably wants to use the Chain of Reversion to restitch his spirit together.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009279	However, Hauberk too is the key to closing the dimensional crack.{nl}The reason why I left him the way he was, was to store power for the key's functions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009280	Hauberk hasn't accumulated all of his spirit yet, so he wouldn't be hard to face against.{nl}Catch him again and close the dimensional crack with the Chain of Reversion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009281	The District 4 which he ran away to is like a maze. {nl}Kupole Daiva and you would be able to follow him though.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009282	How could Vakarine let Hauberk go on a rampage like that...{nl}Well, I guess she must have a reason for that?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009283	The Oruarma Cathedral is where the goddess recovers her powers. {nl}That is why it should always be safe from the demons. Thank you very much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009284	Please collect the pieces of the Mark of Star that are scattered near Rada Seal.{nl}It will help the goddess recover her powers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009285	Thanks. {nl}If Vakarine recovers, then Dionys should also recover.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009286	So you've come, Savior.{nl}Fortunately, Hauberk seems to be not focused on leaving this place through the dimensional crack.{nl}That means he is not complete yet enough to go out through the dimensional crack.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009287	I think...{nl}What if he wanted to escape without going through the dimensional crack you came here with...{nl}You should look for the crack which has been weakened due to the collapse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009288	The weakest part now is at Nebilau Broken District, so he probably went there.{nl}Please follow him, I will prepare the next step while you do so.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009289	Even if Hauberk does something, it can only be inside the prison.{nl}Hauberk could never run away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009290	With this Night Star Spectral Orb, we can easily find Hauberk.{nl}If Hauberk gives up and tries to run away, I will do my best to block it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009291	I won't be able to stop Hauberk completely, but...{nl}I will try to buy as much time as possible for the Savior.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009292	If Hauberk gives up and tries to run away, I will do my best to stop him. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009293	I won't be able to stop Hauberk completely, but...{nl}I will try to buy as much time as possible for the Savior.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009294	Fortunately, he did not come to my side and he moved as I thought.{nl}With the Savior's power, we can surely catch him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009295	It was a success!{nl}If Hauberk can think straight, he should know he has no time to waste defeating Sigita.{nl}At least, let's hope that's the case.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009296	There is only one way out from here.{nl}It will be our great chance to catch Hauberk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009297	Push Hauberk into the Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}Since Kupole Sigita is blocking Hauberk's exit at the opposite side, you need not to worry about his escape.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009298	Well done.{nl}Hauberk didn't know what to do when he saw me and ran away to the Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009299	Now, Hauberk would be able to defeat me easily...{nl}But, I guess he thought the Revelator would catch up to him right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009300	However, the way up from here is a dead end.{nl}Tell me if you are ready to catch Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009301	Well done.{nl}We will collect Hauberk's sealed strong power now and take it to Vakarine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009302	Vakarine is getting ready to close the dimensional crack with the other Kupoles.{nl}She is desperately waiting for you, so please hurry to the District 5 of the prison.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009303	I need proof to show to Vakarine we've been fighting here.{nl}Can you collect a Demon's Tooth in Hradeti Crossroads?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009304	Thank you. {nl}Please keep this a secret from Vakarine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009305	Savior.{nl}We really appreciate your help in stopping Hauberk.{nl}Because of you, we are now able to close the dimensional crack and retrieve the spirit of Hauberk and the Chain of Reversion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009306	Please do not feel sympathy towards Hauberk.{nl}It is sad that his spirit was torn apart, but he too was a demon to be eliminated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009307	Good. Now this is the last stage... We need to close the dimensional crack.{nl}With your help, we will be able to prevent catastrophe in this prison.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009308	Please prepare, since we will soon start the ritual to seal the dimensional crack.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009309	We must supplement Hauberk's sealed spirit by adding the power of demons nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009310	I would give you the Evening Star Rune, but that is an object that uses my power...{nl}Which means it is not perfectly working yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009311	Defeat the demons at Ausura Chapel and collect traces of the transference.{nl}With those, I would be able to complement my lacking power and complete the Evening Star Rune.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009312	Thanks to you, I can now complete the Evening Star Rune.{nl}Take it. You should collect the souls of the demons with the Evening Star Rune.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009313	You must go to the Lankine Separation District, the Ishisula Broken District and the Hehmastar Isolation District.{nl}I will send the Kupoles once you suppress the demons there using the power of the Evening Star Rune.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009314	Once you do so, they will receive the souls that are needed to close the dimensional crack.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009315	This is a place where originally humans are not allowed to enter. {nl}But, you are special and thus granted permission by Vakarine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009316	Vakarine should recover soon...{nl}She was already tired and has gotten weaker due to the battle with Nuaele.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009317	This prison was created by Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Vakarine comes here periodically and manages this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009318	Oh... my poor Dionys... I am so sorry for giving you this big burden.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009319	We weren't able to monitor all the demons in the prison.{nl}That's why we engraved Sealing Tokens on them so they couldn't unleash their power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009320	Hauberk's spirit has become strong enough to handle the dimensional crack because of your efforts.{nl}The Chain of Reversion is also ready.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009321	We will close the dimensional crack now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009322	The Kupoles and I will try our best to seal the dimensional crack.{nl}This is our only chance... if we fail this time, we may not have another chance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009323	I repeat, this is the last chance for the demons to make a counter-attack.{nl}Until the dimensional crack completely seals off, please resist their attacks.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009324	Every disaster that struck this land is over now.{nl}Savior. We owe everything to you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009325	Everything stemmed from our arrogance.{nl}When Laima warned us that a time of hardship would come...{nl}I believed in myself so much that I could not understand what she meant.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009326	But, your sacred energy tells me everything.{nl}I believe it will be your power and not us that will save this world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009327	I cannot be of any help due to the circumstances.{nl}But, I will stay here and do my best until the Day of Salvation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009328	There is one more thing, though.{nl}The dimensional crack that was engraved here is also engraved at various places in your world.{nl}The most dangerous place among them now is Dina Bee Farm..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009329	My sister Austeja is having a hard battle alone.{nl}Please also help her as you have helped me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009330	Once Dionys recovers, Vakarine will feel less pressured.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009331	Thank you.{nl}If Dionys recovers completely, it'll be all thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009332	Can you deal with the dimensional crack at Gavara Isolation District?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009333	Wait a minute. {nl}The Knights of Kaliss told us that the important thing is located deep inside the fortress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009334	We should go move deeper inside so we can start working on what we are both looking for.{nl}I will try looking for the outpost area with this monocle. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009335	Hmm... there's nothing special.{nl}Instead, there are many Royal Army guards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009336	There are too many Royal Army guards to go further inside.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009337	We should lure the Royal Army guards in order to go deeper inside.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009338	That's right. We have Resounding Bombs!
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009339	Resounding Bombs make really loud sounds although their explosiveness isn't that great.{nl}When you detonate them at various places, the soldiers should move to the locations where the sounds come from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009340	I don't have Resounding Bombs at the moment, but I can make them if I have necessary materials. {nl}For example, if I have Herbs and bombs. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009341	I will look for the bombs so I want you to look for the herbs.{nl}Be careful not to be detected by the Royal Army guards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009342	When you collect all the herbs, let's meet at the lower side of the hallway at the upper floor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009343	The Royal Army guards are on patrol so you should be careful all the time.{nl}I am sure they are busy getting hit instead of explaining for the situation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009344	You brought them well without getting detected by the Royal Army guards.{nl}I am sorry. When they get hot, they make loud sounds.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009345	Okay. Shall we start the work of the grave robbers?{nl}I saw the Royal Army guards have more bombs than they can handle.{nl}You know what that means, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009346	No. no. We are not that kind of people. {nl}We don't mean to send them to the goddesses...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009347	We just want to knock them out and take the bombs. {nl}You can do it right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009348	I will get ready to make Resounding Bombs.{nl}Just knock them out and bring the bombs. Okay?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009349	Even if you get caught by the Royal Army guards, don't tell them about me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009350	Good. It's not like they've been detected right?{nl}I will make the Resounding Bombs so wait a bit.{nl}If this works out, we can move deeper inside.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009351	We've completed the Resounding Bombs. {nl}If these detonate well, the Royal Army guards will {nl}move to the locations where the sounds came from. {nl}We will use that moment to head deeper inside.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009352	Here are the Resounding Bombs. I've made them quickly so I can't guarantee their stability.{nl}Please set them well at the hallway on the upper floor and the lower side of the gathering place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009353	You should be careful since I can't guarantee their stability...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009354	Have you set all of them?{nl}Let's wait until they explode.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009355	The Resounding Bombs should be exploding soon.{nl}Cover your ears since they make a loud boom when they explode.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009356	We don't have time to waste. Let's hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009357	Phew...{nl}I guess the Royal Army guards won't be able to chase after us here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009358	We should pray that what we are looking for should be inside. {nl}Go first. Let's meet at Drill Ground of Confliction!
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009359	You are an outsider... but, thanks for rescuing me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009360	Monsters are going crazy due to the loud sounds.{nl}They were almost annihilated.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009361	If we go by principles, you guys should be punished by kingdom orders.{nl}But, since you've saved me and many of our colleagues have failed...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009362	The safety of our colleagues is more important than your punishment.{nl}If you help us reclaim our camp, then we will forget about the punishment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009363	First, rescue our fallen colleagues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009364	If you run away, we'll be in big trouble, so, a soldier will be accompanying you.{nl}We shall take care of your colleague.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009365	Don't do anything stupid.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009366	When our colleagues gather again, we are going to retrieve our camp.{nl}There were many monsters from the beginning, but I've never seen them going crazy like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009367	Thank you for rescuing our colleagues, but we haven't retrieved the camp yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009368	Please help us little more. {nl}It's not a request. It is an order.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009369	This place is being protected by the kingdom secretly.{nl}We here too are composed of the selected members from the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009370	We are going to reclaim the camp and try our best not to be conquered again. {nl}By doing so, we would be able to protect ourselves from monsters and intruders like you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009371	We need some temporary weapons and armors.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009372	Many pieces of equipment were dropped on the ground while fighting against enemies.{nl}While I am taking care of my colleagues, please pick up that equipment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009373	We also have our pride and fame. {nl}We are going to reclaim our camp so that the sacrifices of our colleagues won't be lost in vain.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009374	Thank you for collecting the equipment.{nl}We are also ready to reclaim the camp.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009375	Okay. We will begin now.{nl}If you are scared, you can hide behind us. Let's go!
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009376	Monsters are getting ready at our camp.{nl}Be careful since they are not easy to defeat.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009377	Okay. Let's go in!
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009378	I am sorry for not recognizing you.{nl}Your skills are so astonishing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009379	If It wasn't for that sudden attack, we would have not lost the camp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009380	We can't just relax even though we've reclaimed the camp.{nl}We don't know when the monsters will attack again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009381	But, my colleagues are too tired.{nl}You should help us until we organize the camp again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009382	It will be simple if you could place a barricade.{nl}It would help stop the monsters for a while.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009383	There is wood inside the supply box so please set the barricade with that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009384	I've told you before, but you can't be at the Fortress of the Land.{nl}I am going to be quiet about the trespass since you've helped us so please leave at once.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009385	If you resist, we would have to execute the kingdom order.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009386	If a person becomes a handful of soils after his death, can you imagine how he will be treated.{nl}The soils that once conquered this world...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009387	Yes. You managed to avoid being like me. Yes...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009388	Please hide.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009389	I just hope the chasers won't find this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009390	We can't trust the demons anymore...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009391	You better get the black herbs fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009392	The priests are only concentrating on the altars so they don't care whether we die in hunger or not.{nl}They think everything will be solved if they pray hard.{nl}That's why we decided to take an action.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009393	It is most definitely sinful to obtain the revelation in this manner.{nl}But of course, this is the only way to obtain Maven's fourth key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009394	We should find out whether it is just a symbol, or if it is endowed with some kind of power.{nl}First, I want you to collect Lizardmen leather from the Abandoned Grape Farm.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009395	Recently, we saw a similar looking girl at the Crystal Mine. {nl}But, strangely, she wasn't able to say anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009396	Lizardmen are monsters that appeared in great number ever since Medzio Diena.{nl}If some kind of power is in this tree, it will definitely react to their leather.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009397	Revelator, this is astonishing!{nl}When I apply the tree's power to the monster leathers that you brought, the leathers corroded right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009398	Help me, please.{nl}I have to harvest, but my crops will all die soon because of the poison.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009399	You are not... a messenger.{nl}This place is a military district, but we desperately need help these days.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009400	It seems that you are quite competent.{nl}Can you help us a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009401	Thanks.{nl}There's one thing you need to know about this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009402	This place is the strategic location which was built when Ruklys caused the chaos.{nl}Eminent who was the prime minister at that time came up with it to block their marching route. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009403	They are maintained to block monsters or demons nowadays.{nl}Ever since Medzio Diena, we have not received any supplies or orders from the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009404	How could he just abandon his duty as a person who belongs to the kingdom?{nl}Our duty is to protect the magic circle here when some incident occurs here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009405	Actually, we were having hard time since we didn't have any forces to look for the subordinate who went missing after going there to repair it.{nl}His name is Higgs. Please look for him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009406	Are you the one sent by the commanding officer?{nl}I'll be alright now!
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009407	I think it is near Udringal Empty Lot.{nl}I am worried about whether he is wounded in this cold weather.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151001_009408	While he was going to do his duty, he was attacked by monsters. {nl}It will be hard to carry out the mission in his condition or go back alone.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009896	You might... have to look in every single floor.{nl}Psychokinos aren't that easy to classify, you see...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009897	Looking at your expression right now, I think that tome is definitely going to help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009898	Make sure to keep that in mind.{nl}What I'm going to teach you now is just to help make your journey a little bit easier.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009899	You've finally reached the last stage of the Linker.{nl}I recently started on a new study which I think will be useful to you as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009900	What if Linkers could connect not only to people's spirits but their emotions as well...{nl}I think this would allow for a stronger string of mana.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009901	What do you think?{nl}Think of it as your last task and helping me out with my research.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009902	Thanks.{nl}Let's see... I'm going to need some kind of trace of a spirit and emotions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009903	Get me a Crystal of Twisted Soul from Manahas and {nl}a Shard of Chaotic Emotions from Genar Field.{nl}They'll be excellent objects of study for my research on spirits and emotions.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009904	Looks like I'll be able to finish my research in no time with such a helpful assistant.{nl}This is all for the benefit of Linkers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009905	So. While we prepare for research, let me teach you about a Linker's strongest type of magic.{nl}It becomes quite difficult since it's the last stage, but I have faith that you can do it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009906	Thaumaturges, unlike other wizards, focus more on actual battles.{nl}Even if you're trying to learn more magic, which is admirable in itself, {nl}there's only so much I can teach you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009907	You're doing well.{nl}Go to the 1st floor of the Mage Tower and fight the Salamander.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009908	Sometimes learning from a difficult opponent is important.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009909	Go to the 1st floor of the Mage Tower and defeat the Salamander. {nl}There's something you must learn there. That's how I learned, too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009910	You're mighty good.{nl}I'm sure you've learned something from this battle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009911	Always remember that.{nl}There's magic even stronger than the one I taught you so far, {nl}but even that magic comes down to how you use it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009912	I wish other people could be as passionate about magic as you are.{nl}But getting into something blindly can do you damage, too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009913	Yes...{nl}I think what you need is some high-leveled battle experience.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009914	I heard Escanciu Village hosts a fierce type of monster called Reaverpede.{nl}Defeating it will be a valuable experience for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009915	It is not an easy opponent, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009916	Elementalists have to combine different elemental properties.{nl}So, the more diverse your experience is, the better the payoff.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009917	Excellent job.{nl}I feel confident about teaching you other types of magic now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009918	To prove yourself, you have to battle.{nl} I hear there's a dangerous monster called Biteregina at Owl Burial Ground.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009919	You need to able to face danger if you want to become the best Sapper.{nl}What do you say?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009920	The best techniques will give you the best payoff.{nl}I expect great things from you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009921	Your skills are impressive.{nl}I promise that, if you follow my teachings, you will become an even greater Sapper.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009922	You say you want to become the greatest Hunter?{nl}For someone of your caliber, that is not unthinkable.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009923	But don't think you're going to do well no matter what.{nl}First you need to do something for me; then I'll teach you a new technique.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009924	As a Hunter you need to be able to face different monsters.{nl}You need to be able to keep your composure in front of any opponent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009925	Go and defeat some monsters in Starving Demon's Way, Pilgrim Path, {nl}Altar Way, Forest of Prayer and Apsimesti Crossroads.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009926	Being picky with hunting won't help your experience or your training.{nl}To learn how to keep your cool when faced with any monster, go out and face different types.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009927	So, what do you say?{nl}I'm sure you must have a feeling about this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009928	Alright, from now on just do as I say.{nl}I'll teach you the path of a real Hunter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009929	How to be a stronger Wugushi?{nl}Help me make poison and I'll teach you a few things.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009930	Thanks.{nl}I want you to catch me some poisonous monsters in this jar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009931	It's not that easy to trap them, though.{nl}You have to make sure they're tired enough, then you can put them in the jar.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009932	You can make very potent poison from monster venom, you see.{nl}But bring them alive. If they die, the venom disappears and it won't work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009933	Shall we learn a new Wugushi technique, then?{nl}I'm going to go straight into it, so pay attention.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009934	You work well, no doubt about that.{nl}Keep learning more advanced techniques and you could become famous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009935	This time we're going to test your reconnaissance skills.{nl}All you need to do is scout the place I tell you to. Got it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009936	Go to the Mage Tower.{nl}I'll let you know the exact location later.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009937	Survey the area and write a report. Remember each floor has different areas.{nl}Try not to miss anything and record everything you can.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009938	The work of a Scout is synonymous with reconnaissance.{nl}And perfecting your basic skills is the best training you can get.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009939	You came back safely.{nl}I see you're not just agile but you have scounting skills, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009940	Come find me whenever you want to learn a new technique.{nl}And don't forget: perfecting your basic skills is the best training you can get.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009941	The best Thaumaturge... I'm surprised you're already at a level where you can aim for that.{nl}But the domain of the Thaumaturge is very, very wide. It's practically infinite.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009942	Alright. Enough of this small talk.{nl}Are you ready to show me just how well you can control your magic?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009943	I have a testing site at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Go there and move the Magic Concentration Orbs to the magic detection area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009944	If you lose control of your magic they can end up in another place, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009945	I used to train like that all the time when I was younger.{nl}Things became a bit of a mess after Medzio Diena, but it'll be fine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009946	Impressive.{nl}I knew you could do it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009947	Since you completed this test I'm going to pass on to you my last teaching...{nl}How you use and develop it, however, is up to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009948	We create our own limitations.{nl}I can see you feel the same way.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009949	Being an Elementalist doesn't mean you can control all the elements.{nl}However, we don't let that become a weakness to us, either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009950	Especially for someone like you who's aiming for the top level of Elementalist...{nl}You mustn't let that happen.{nl}Understood?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009951	One element property we don't often deal with... is darkness.{nl}I wonder if your skills are enough to face this particular element.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009952	The Netherbovine in Poslinkis Forest is known for the element of darkness.{nl}Go there and defeat it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009953	For us who believe in the goddesses, working with darkness is taboo.{nl}Although there are those who risk it for the single purpose of defeating the goddesses' enemies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009954	Your abilities are remarkable.{nl}I'd say you're more than qualified to learn the highest level of the Elementalist.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009955	Allow me to teach you, then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009956	I have a task for you. The request came from Wings of Vaivora.{nl}It seems like some baron opened a portal that needs to be closed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009957	It was... the Demon Prison.{nl}I wonder what this person was thinking of opening a place full with crawling demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009958	Apparently they sent this request to other places as well, but we can't miss it, can we?{nl}Be the first to complete the task and I'll teach you one of the strongest Wugushi techniques.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009959	Your target is the Rajatoad in Demon Prison District 1.{nl}An easy opponent for a Wugushi, but you can never be too careful in that prison.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009960	Some people have really lost their sense out of fear of disaster.{nl}Orsha is struggling enough as it is. {nl}I don't know if it's a good idea to go there, but I don't want more people to get hurt, either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009961	Seems like you did a very good job after all.{nl}It was a difficult task, but I have to admit you have skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009962	Alright. Let's get started on the new technique. {nl}I promise to look after you until you become a top Wugushi.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009963	So you came to learn the last technique of the Scouts.{nl}Before that, there's something I want you to do for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009964	It's a favor for the Scout Master...{nl}Apparently the Wings of Vaivora sent us a request but there's no one to carry it out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009965	And you're a full-fledged Scout now.{nl}I think this will be a good chance to see what you've learned so far, {nl}and I'm confident you can pull through it...{nl}What do you say?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009966	The mission is to defeat the Deadborn in Demon Prison District 1.{nl}They're very powerful monsters, but for someone of {nl}your level it won't be that difficult of an opponent.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009967	Your expertise in reconnaissance and stealth won't keep you safe forever.{nl}I hope you keep that in mind and take care.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009968	You fought bravely.{nl}As promised, I'm going to teach you the last technique.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009969	From the way you completed all my tasks I think you'll have no problems learning it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009970	The Himil family was at the center of the original Schaffenstar.{nl}Then they left, and when I was born they were no longer an archer family but a warrior family.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009971	We can be misunderstood for dealing with evil forces {nl}or using the power of demons instead of the goddesses.{nl}But using evil forces isn't evil in itself.{nl}We remain within the realm of our magic and the goddesses' blessing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009972	I came from outside the kingdom.{nl}This place wasn't the only one affected by Medzio Diena, you know.{nl}I came to see what's happening here, but it's taking longer than expected.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009973	The name Saker was given to me by the royal family.{nl}That's how dedicated I am to the kingdom, as I always will be.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009974	I was in the army once.{nl}I couldn't get used to living with so many rules, however, so I quit shortly after.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009975	Plague Doctors don't depend solely on the grace of the goddesses for their healing powers.{nl}We also use human medicine, which means we are able to cure ailments other clerics cannot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009976	Everything in the world can be expressed in numbers.{nl}Even music. You don't believe it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009977	Dragoons are exceptionally brave warriors.{nl}No one can stop a Dragoon charging with their spear.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009978	Sometimes simple persuasion isn't just enough and you must do things by force.{nl}This may very well be the case with wizards now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009979	When you curse someone you must dig your own grave too.{nl}Do you get what that means?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009980	Carrying a heavy cannon around all the time is far from easy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009981	Not to mention that cannon balls cannot be compared to bullets or arrows.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009982	I'm not just trying to tell you how hard it is for me, though.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009983	Isn't the markmanship of Musketeers just fascinating? With skills like that....{nl}You can fire fast and clear a whole group of enemies or step up and deliver that fatal blow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009984	After Medzio Diena, Plague Doctors became more important than ever.{nl}That's why I want to mentor future Plague Doctors and help the world.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009985	I know many people think numbers are a pain to work with.{nl}It perplexes me how something so simple and clear can be difficult.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009986	To put it simply, a Chaplain is... a priest that is affiliated with the army.{nl}It is believed that helping the army in accordance to {nl}the will of the goddesses will in turn protect everyone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009987	Everyone that goes to war desperately wants a sacellum, {nl}so that they may receive blessings from the goddesses.{nl}That is why Chaplains are needed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009988	So. It seems that you have finally made up your mind about becoming a Chaplain.{nl}A priest like yourself is always welcome.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009989	Although... There are some formalities left.{nl}To cut straight to the chase, how about helping {nl}the Royal Army stationed here for your assignment?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009990	The more I see, the more I like it.{nl}The Royal Army here at Dvasia Peak is spearheading a road to the Gateway of the Great King.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009991	They are running into a lot of trouble due to the intense hindrance of the monsters.{nl}Wounded soldiers are only the beginning, the amount {nl}of materials stolen by monster is simply staggering.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009992	Talking about dealing with a few monsters...{nl}It will be a great deal of help to the Royal Army {nl}if you could retrieve some of the materials from them as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009993	You will be able to leave a memorable impression on the Royal Army if you help them out.{nl}Of course, it is also good reference to use when recommending you to become a Chaplain.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009994	Excellent.{nl}I have already started to hear praise of your deeds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009995	Now, let me tell you what Chaplains are capable of.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009996	(Something seems to be engraved here, but the black fog makes it too dark to see.){nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009997	The inner shell of Keparis is perfect.{nl}They last a long time after being polished and engraved. {nl}Would you go and get me some?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009998	You were faster than I thought.{nl}Now I can polish this inner shell and make it into a scripture. Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_009999	String made from Orange Dandel leather is good, but a bit short.{nl}I'm going to give you an anvil for tanning.{nl}Can you make some bookbinding string from the leather string?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010000	First you need to get some leather string from Orange Dandels.{nl}Then you use this anvil to turn it into some sturdy bookbinding strings.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010001	(There are engraved images of goddesses, humans and a demon goddess.)
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010002	Blacksmith Ilanai
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010003	Antanas sent you here, right?{nl}I have to tell you, this was not an easy request...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010004	Not many would take this order, you know. {nl}Are you engraving a holy spell?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010005	The chisel? Ah. {nl}I couldn't get it exactly the way Antanas wanted so I had someone else take care of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010006	Go see Jura.{nl}She works at the equipment shop.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010007	See you later.{nl}Make sure to come back if you need anything repaired.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010008	Equipment Merchant Jura
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010009	The chisel?{nl}Ah, you mean the one Ilanai ordered?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010010	Jura is in charge of the chisel, not me.{nl}She's the equipment merchant.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010011	Good, this is just how I wanted it.{nl}Now I can get started.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010012	Did you get the chisel?{nl}Special orders are always welcome so feel free to come back.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010013	We're collecting the objects left behind by the Kedora Merchant Alliance during Medzio Diena.{nl}Our leader Merrisa is in charge of the operation.

QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010016	Please do not feel sympathy towards Hauberk.{nl}It is sad that his spirit was torn apart, but he too was a demon to be eliminated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010017	He is merely incapable of remembering the sins he committed in the past.{nl}It will be a bloody day when he remembers his name...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010018	I could not tell you the truth as Hauberk was near you.{nl}Please forgive me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010019	Hauberk is also a sinner. {nl}You don't need to sympathize with him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010020	Be weary of Hauberk trying to recollect his Soul Fragments.{nl}His Soul Fragments merely do not remember each other...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010021	It will be a bloody day if when he remembers his name...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010022	This was all because we were so pretentious.{nl}When Laima warned us that trouble was coming...{nl}I was so confident in myself I couldn't understand the meaning of Her words.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010023	Are you the person they sent here?{nl}Even if it's not you, will you please help our village?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010024	It wasn't like that on Medzio Diena, but then the bees suddenly started turning into monsters. {nl}Other apiaries are already devastated; I'm worried about what will happen to ours.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010025	You there.{nl}Are you with that group of Revelators that ran away?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010026	Good.{nl}I only believed the priests but I can't take it any longer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010027	So I want to recruit a talented Revelator like you, what do you say?{nl}I'll pay you well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010028	You came back faster than I thought.{nl}So. Did you have a look?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010029	Are you the Revelator who purified Seal Tower?{nl}Finally... you're here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010030	These seals exist because of several dimensional cracks spread throughout the world...{nl}If the seal had been broken, the demons would have started an invasion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010031	On Medzio Diena I lost most of my power, so I gathered all that was left of it to make a seal...{nl}Alone, however, all I could manage to put together was this measly seal...
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010032	Thanks to you, the seal of Uskis Arable Land is now stable.{nl}However, many other Revelators have lost their consciousness {nl}to the evil energy of the seal in Spring Light Woods.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010033	It looks like the discussion is over.{nl}Let's see what conclusion they came to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010034	When you first came to see me I wondered if you were worthy of the title of Hoplite...{nl}But here you are now, a full-fledged Hoplite.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010035	At last it seems it's time for your final test.{nl}I want to see the results of your training so far.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010036	The Apsimesti Crossroads have long been the stage of Hoplites' final test.{nl}Many Hoplites have fought monsters and battled there until their spears broke...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010037	All their broken spears and armors...{nl}The fruit of those efforts will be the judge of your final qualifications.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010038	This test won't simply serve to measure your strength.{nl}The level you're trying to reach cannot be achieved that easily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010039	To complete it you will also have to experience yourself the {nl}efforts that others have gone through to reach the final level.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010040	Good job.{nl}You'll be a good role model for future aspiring Hoplites.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010041	I know you're already at the top level, but if there's anything you need, just come see me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010042	You look a lot more striking than the first time I saw you, my friend.{nl}Alright, let me teach you the last Barbarian techniques.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010043	I will be frank, I do have my doubts about you on whether you can handle them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010044	Talk is cheap. What matters is your skill.{nl}This medicine is something we use for training in my hometown... {nl}Actually it's more like a poison.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010045	Drink it and defeat the monsters down at the Apsimesti Crossroads.{nl}Of course, you'll have to do it on your own.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010046	But you're strong enough, so. You can quit if you want.{nl}If that's all you want to be.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010047	It seems your passion for power is even greater than mine.{nl}I like it. I'm going to teach you everything I know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010048	Yeah. You're a true Rodelero now.{nl}But to really become stronger you have to learn how to give up your strengths once in a while.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010049	You seem ready.{nl}If so, head to the Apsimesti Crossroads and fight some monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010050	Sounds easy, right?{nl}How about fighting without your shield then?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010051	A Rodelero's shield is its most reliable ally.{nl}But you cannot be a true warrior if you're not confident in your own strength.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010052	Once again you proved your potential.{nl}Leave the rest to me. I'm going to teach you techniques that'll make your jaw drop.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010053	I thought you'd give up after a while...{nl}But here you are. You must really like Cataphracts, huh?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010054	You're not so bad yourself.{nl}If you complete the task I'm about to give you, I might just start to like you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010055	It's very simple.{nl}All you have to do is go to the Apsimesti Crossroads and defeat some monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010056	But don't forget, we are Cataphracts.{nl}I'll be really disappointed if you're not straddled on your companion's back at all times.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010057	If you're not familiar with battling on top of your companion, {nl}you might as well give up on being a Cataphract.{nl}Don't tell me you feel dizzy!

QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010059	Feel free to come see me again.{nl}I think I can put up with teaching you a couple of things.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010060	I'm sorry, but there's something I need you to do that's more urgent than your final test.{nl}The Apsimesti Crossroads are being crowded with monsters and people are in danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010061	Use the things you've learned to defeat the monsters.{nl}I should be the one to deal with this but it's an urgent matter, so we'll do this instead of the test.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010062	A broker standing between life and death...{nl}That's how the Bokor Master from Klaipeda described the Bokor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010063	However, that doesn't apply to humans.{nl}You must always help people according to the will of the goddesses. Remember that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010064	That was an impressive deed.{nl}I will now teach you everything I know about being a Bokor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010065	I think it was when I was around your level...{nl}Tesla told me this as his last teaching.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010066	You can have the best eye for materials and the best techniques...{nl}But without proper maintenance you won't last long as a sculptor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010067	Back then I didn't understand what he meant, but now I think I do.{nl}You can make the best statue out of the best materials, {nl}but if your work doesn't last, isn't it worthless?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010068	That's why maintenance is so important.{nl}I just received an order that would be good for you, would you like to give it a try?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010069	Let's make this your final test, then.{nl}The priests asked for repair work on the statues of Goddess Vakarine in Orsha and Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010070	First go to Bellai Rainforest and collect some greasy Papayam pulp.{nl}I'll use it to make a balm to repair the statues.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010071	Tesla always said that a work of honest care perseveres for hundreds of years.{nl}Hm... I think he was right.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010072	You're back already?{nl}Just wait a moment. I'll make the balm right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010073	The balm is finished.{nl}Go to Orsha and Fedimian and use it to repair the statues of Goddess Vakarine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010074	Take good care of them, they are statues of the goddess after all.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010075	Tesla used to always tell me this.{nl}The duty of a Dievdirbys is not only to carve the piece, but to look after it with gentle care.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010076	If you want to become a memorable Dievdirbys, you must never forget this state of mind.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010077	I was just starting to think it was about time you came to see me.{nl}Alright. If you're ready to show me just how strong your faith is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010078	You see, Paladins are fearless because we believe the goddesses will always protect us.{nl}So. Make sure you're ready for this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010079	This ancient relic is cursed.{nl}It has the power to attract monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010080	Go to Hyth Cliff in Starving Demon's Way.{nl}Find the Abandoned Altar and use the relic on it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010081	I assume you know what happens next.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010082	Right now so much is being tainted by evil forces.{nl}But as long as we believe in the goddesses, nothing can stop the Paladins.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010083	I say you have what it takes to be called a true Paladin now.{nl}Alright. I'm going to teach you what a Paladin is really about.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010084	It seems you're finally starting to feel the limits of your abilities.{nl}Know that in the final level of Rodelero... you can break those limits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010085	Whether or not you're able to face that is another question.{nl}The Colimencia in the Greene Manor should help you with that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010086	I believe that people have no limits.{nl}They simply go through moments of distress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010087	I merely offer people a way to overcome them.{nl}So all you need to do is prove that you're ready to face you own distress.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010088	How was fighting such a strong enemy?{nl}I'm sure you realized your own shortcomings.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010089	But if you chose the path of the Rodelero you must carry it through to the end.{nl}Isn't that what breaking your limits is all about?
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010090	If your goal is to become the best Cataphract,  you need to book some results.{nl}Right? I'm talking about defeating an enemy that'll make your name known across the country.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010091	I'm sure you've heard about the savage Gaigalas of Tenants' Farm.{nl}The number of victims killed by it is countless, they say.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010092	That should be enough for you.{nl}Go and defeat it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010093	There's nothing the spear of a true Cataphract can't break through.{nl}Just keep this in mind if you want to become the best there is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010094	Impressive. The more I see what you can do, the more I like you.{nl}The title of greatest Cataphract is coming for you, that is for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010095	How you carry out your mission is up to you, {nl}but your blessings are the salvation of many others. {nl}Helping others in relieving their agony is a virtue every Sadhu of the goddesses needs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010096	However, you must possess the power to put it into practice.{nl}If you want to reach the highest power of the Sadhu, show me that you have it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010097	Go and face the evil deeds of the monsters that terrorize us.{nl}I hear the Colimencia is causing mayhem at the Greene Manor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010098	To me there is no real final stage.{nl}I hope you abandon all conceit and keep advancing in your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010099	Other Paladins are already following the footsteps of your heroic acts.{nl}But I want to see for myself just how much you're worth.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010100	Since this is your final test, it's won't be easy.{nl}Maybe the Gaigalas at Tenants' Farm... Yes, that will suit you as a worthy opponent.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010101	As long as you believe in the goddesses there's nothing to fear.{nl}It's what I've been telling you since the first time you became a Paladin.
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010102	I know rumors are always a little exaggerated. {nl}But you, you sure live up to your story.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010103	I'm sorry I ever doubted you were worthy of the title of Paladin.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20151224_010104	This isn't exactly a level anyone can reach...{nl}I sincerely hope you'll prove that you're worthy of that position.

QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010820	{nl}Escanciu Village is nice and far, too.{nl}Maybe I should check the trumpet...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010821	Do you mean it? That would be great.{nl}The divine spirit in Escanciu Village loves the sound of this trumpet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010822	This is the score for the spirit's favorite song.{nl}Play this to the divine spirit, I'm sure they'll love it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010823	Just make sure to hit the notes right, the divine spirit of Escanciu Village is very sensitive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010824	I knew the Divine Spirit was gonna love that song.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010825	Are you saying there's an evil spirit in the Mokusul Chamber?{nl}Very well, I will find it and banish it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010826	If you say so, alright. Thank you.{nl}I will tell you how to drive the spirit away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010827	{nl}Use my evil spirit detector to find it, then trap it with the draining orb.{nl}You should make sure to trap the evil spirit as soon as you find it, or else it may escape.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010828	And don't let your guard down after you find the spirit.{nl}Evil spirits are extremely agile and could attack when you least expect.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010829	Thanks to you those who lie in the Mokusul Chamber can rest in peace at last.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010830	I've taken on the work of Appraiser Master.{nl}Fedimian has always been a city where many visit, and so too are there many who request my identifying work.{nl}But what's more, because I've become the Appraiser Master even more people are requesting me. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010831	Even though there's a lot of work for me to do here, I still receive requests from my clients for in-person identifications.    
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010832	{nl}When this happens, it's very difficult.{nl}I understand requesting in-person visits because of personal reasons but I also have a lot to do here. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010833	Oh, I'm happy to hear that.{nl}If you help me, I'll teach you my identification techniques. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010834	{nl}After I became Appraiser Master, the Fencer Master and Orsha's Accessory Merchant, Jurus, sent me letters.{nl} Their positions keep them busy, so they requested that I make an in-person trip.     
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010835	{nl}The Fencer Master asked for identification on a family heirloom.{nl}She wants to sell her heirlooms to help the poor but she needs my certificate. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010836	{nl}Then, Jurus asked me to identify his shop's accessories.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010837	{nl}But after also becoming a Master I've sudden gotten busier and, after considering the rest of my work, I can't go.{nl}So, you see, please bring the Fencer Master's heirlooms and Orsha's accessories to me. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010838	{nl}If you do, I can identify them and also judge to see if I can issue certificates. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010839	The Fencer Master is in the Forest of Prayer, while the Accessory Merchant, Jurus, is in Orsha. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010840	That's the Fencer Master's heirloom..and Jurus' accessories too. {nl} Please give them to me. I'll try identifying them. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010841	Wow.. both are such fine items.{nl}The Fencer Master's heirloom is well kept. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010842	{nl}The craftsmanship level of Jurus' accessories is quite high.{nl} Even if I compare it with accessories from the nobles and royals, I can barely notice a difference. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010843	{nl}I will now issue the quality certificates. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010844	The Appraiser Master is writing the quality certificates. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010845	To show my thanks for helping me, I want to teach you my identification skills, but there is still a lot of work for me to do. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010846	{nl}Please deliver these certificates to the Fencer Master and the Accessory Merchant, Jurus.{nl}I will prepare to teach you about identification skills on your return. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010847	The value of the Fencer Master's heirloom is so impressive that it's an item that can't be carelessly judged.{nl}And Jurus' accessories are so beautifully and exquisitely crafted that they can't be easily imitated. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010848	{nl}These items cannot be thoughtlessly degraded. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010849	Did you deliver the certificates? 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010850	{nl}You did well in my place.{nl}As a way to relay you, I will teach you my techniques. 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010851	If the fragment you're carrying is imbued with divine energy, it could very well be a relic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010852	Allow me to have a look at it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010853	Your fragment looks like a simple piece of a wand.{nl}I'm... not sure if there's any divine energy in it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010854	{nl}Although it could be that I'm simply not skilled enough to detect it yet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010855	{nl}Oh, now that I think of it, I did see a few demons carrying around similar fragments.{nl}I didn't pay much attention to it then, but it would be good to investigate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010856	{nl}If it's not too much to ask, would you retrieve a few of their fragments?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010857	I will be studying the fragment we have meanwhile.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010858	You brought the fragments.{nl}I can confirm whether they are related to each other or not now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010859	After gathering all the fragments I do feel a faint divine energy, like you said.{nl}If my guesses are correct, these fragments could belong to a destroyed relic.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010860	{nl}Destroying a holy relic like this can only be the work of Naktis or her subordinates.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010861	{nl}Unfortunately, Inea isn't sure about the fragments, either.{nl}They do seem to form the shape of a wand, but there is no such object on our list of recovered relics.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010862	{nl}I suppose it lost its power and value as a relic after being destroyed.{nl}And there are still many relics Inea hasn't recovered; she must have been unable to collect these fragments as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010863	{nl}Oh, but she did say something that could be useful.{nl}Apparently Priest Ruodell at the Grand Corridor has found a fragment similar to these.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010864	{nl}Take these two fragments and go see Priest Ruodell at the Grand Corridor.{nl}He can sense divine energy better than any priest. He may just find a connection between the fragments.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010865	You brought the wand fragments.{nl}Let me have a look, then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010866	I found similar fragments inside the Main Chamber.{nl}The divine energy in them was so faint I nearly missed them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010867	{nl}I couldn't find any mention of the fragments in the order's list of recovered relics, however.{nl}They could belong to an old, forgotten relic.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010868	{nl}I was going to try and recover the remaining fragments and bring them back to the order.{nl}But it seems we already have all of them here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010869	{nl}First, I'm going to use divine power to examine the fragments.{nl}If it's not too much to ask, would you handle any demons nearby?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010870	I'm trying to see whether the relic can be restored, but it could take some time.{nl}Have you cleared the area of demons?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010871	Fortunately I happen to have all the tools I need; I believe I can restore the relic to its original shape.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010872	I did restore the relic using my tools and some divine power, but it still feels unstable.{nl}I suppose it's inevitable, considering it was already destroyed once.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010873	{nl}I believe Priest Goda is preparing a magic circle at the Sanctuary.{nl}I heard he was still missing an instrument to finish the magic circle...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010874	{nl}Would you take this wand to Priest Goda so he may use it for the magic circle?{nl}It may be a little unstable, but it does contain divine energy and I'm sure it can be used for the circle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010875	Unstable as it is, I don't think the wand would be considered a proper relic by the order.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010876	{nl}I believe it will be put to better use by helping Priest Goda finish his magic circle.{nl}I suppose I'll be hearing from the order later...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010877	Have you delivered the wand yet?{nl}You ought to hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010878	So this is the wand.{nl}I heard about it from the other priests.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010879	As you know, I'm creating a magic circle to deal with the demons in the Sanctuary.{nl}It's a magic circle meant to weaken the power of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010880	{nl}I haven't been able to finish it, however.{nl}I'm missing an instrument I can use to complete the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010881	{nl}The wand you brought looks a little unstable, like it could easily break.{nl}But I suppose the divine energy could preserve it for a while.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010882	{nl}Would you please complete the magic circle for me?{nl}I'm afraid the demons would notice if I tried to move there myself.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010883	After the magic circle is completed, I'll make sure to find another instrument to replace the wand.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010884	You finished the magic circle! I already feel the demons becoming weaker.{nl}Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010885	Have you seen a type of monster that looks like a tombstone? They're called Burialers.{nl}I discovered that these monsters were created by combining a tombstone and a spirit through evil energy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010886	{nl}I only wish I could free those poor spirits trapped in the tombstones and guide them to eternal rest...{nl}But I was so invested in the curse, I'm afraid there is no more strength left in me now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010887	{nl}Would you be so kind as to purify the Burialers for me while I recover?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010888	I will give you the holy water you'll need for the purification.{nl}To see the effects, you must use the holy water only after the Burialer has been weakened.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010889	I'll be counting on you while I recover my health.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010890	You purified all the Burialers in the area.{nl}I feel a little better now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010891	{nl}I can deal with the other Burialers from now on.{nl}Thank you for your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010892	Edward
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010893	Oh... Hello there. My name's Edward.{nl}I was just on my way to tend to some important issues.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010894	{nl}Unfortunately, I was attacked by monsters on the road and they took all my equipment.{nl}Luckily I escaped in one piece, but I'm going to need a weapon for my protection.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010895	{nl}If that's alright, would you find me my weapons?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010896	I'm missing a dagger and a bow.{nl}They have my name carved on them, so you'll know they're mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010897	Thank you.{nl}I really can't move around without my weapons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010898	You're something else.{nl}Thank you very much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010899	The truth is... my daughter suffers from a rare disease.{nl}I did see a priest who I heard had cured a child suffering from the same illness, but...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010900	{nl}The priest says he cannot cure my daughter right away.{nl}He needs a very particular kind of flower called Davelae, is what he said.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010901	{nl}That's the reason I came all the way here, you see...{nl}I heard from a farmer not long ago that an unknown flower had bloomed where the Tamas live.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010902	{nl}I want to know if this flower is the one I'm looking for... Could you perhaps bring it to me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010903	I would go myself, but I think I sprained an ankle earlier when the monsters attacked.{nl}I saw you handle those monsters and I thought this task wouldn't be too much of a trouble for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010904	I only wish this flower is the one I'm looking for...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010905	I don't think this is a Davelae flower.{nl}It looks too different from what I heard...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010906	{nl}I looked all around for this flower; I don't think I'll find it here.{nl}I guess I'll have to keep going up towards Shaton Farm.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010907	{nl}I'm sorry for the trouble...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010908	Oh, hello, nice to see you here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010909	{nl}I'm afraid I was, yet again, attacked by a group of monsters.{nl}They were too many to handle with my weapons alone, but fortunately I had some paralyzing poison saved up for an emergency.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010910	{nl}I barely managed to escape; I was just catching my breath right now.{nl}I think I'm going to need more poison if I want to keep looking for that flower...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010911	{nl}I asked the tenants if there was any herb around with paralyzing effects, but it seems not.{nl}The only thing that does have those effects is Cyst fluid.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010912	{nl}If it was a herb I could easily pick it myself... but a monster is a little too much for me.{nl}If that's okay, can I ask you to collect some Cyst fluid for me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010913	I'll give you an empty flask.{nl}Please collect the Cysts' fluid in it after you defeat them.{nl}Thank you for your kindness.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010914	I do see a few Cysts over there... but I wouldn't dare go near them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010915	Thank you!{nl}I can coat my arrows with the fluid now and get moving.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010916	{nl}This... Cyst fluid smells awful, now that I notice...{nl}I wonder if that's why it paralyzes other monsters...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010917	Well, I'm still a little sore, but I'm all set to start moving again.{nl}I looked all around the farm but the Davelae flower was nowhere to be seen... the tenants had never heard about it, either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010918	{nl}I hear this road leads to the Reservoir, so that's the path I'm planning to take now.{nl}If you're going in the same direction, would you care to join me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010919	Very well, I'll get going then.{nl}I have my poisoned arrows now, so I can deal with a monster or two.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010920	I'm afraid I'll have to owe you another favor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010921	{nl}It seems the Cyst fluid I was going to use for poison has attracted the monsters.{nl}As I was running away from them I accidentally broke the flask.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010922	{nl}Suddenly a whole horde of them came running.{nl}Sigh... My wounds haven't healed yet and now I'm out of poison. I'm in a bit of a tough spot, but I have to make it through.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010923	{nl}This is nothing, really, compared to the pain my daughter must be going through... I need to keep moving.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010924	You must have been worried for me.{nl}After having depended on you so many times...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010925	My body is starting to hurt all over.{nl}I need to take a Melbania antidote and keep looking for the Davelae flower...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010926	Thank you...!{nl}This should be enough to cure the symptoms.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010927	I'm starting to feel better now.{nl}Oh, and also... I asked a steward here and he said he's seen a flower that looks like the Davelae.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010928	{nl}I want to keep moving right away... but in this condition, I don't think I can get too far...{nl}If that's alright, would you bring me the flower he mentioned?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010929	He said he saw it near the Tvirta Reservoir Embankment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010930	I have a feeling this will be the flower I'm looking for.{nl}If it isn't... Well, I'll just have to keep looking...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010931	Ooohh...! It looks... exactly like the Davelae...!{nl}I've been searching for this flower for so long... I can't even remember when I started.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010932	{nl}My daughter can finally be healthy...{nl}Thank you... thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010933	{nl}I need to return to my daughter right away.{nl}Thank you for finding the flower... I'm forever grateful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010934	Will I finally find the flower here...?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010935	So many thoughts run through my head when I'm wandering around.{nl}Most of all I think of my daughter...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010936	It looks like I'm all out of food for Jareth.{nl}But I can't ask the commander... I need to find some food around here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010937	{nl}I don't think I've recovered enough to do it on my own, though...{nl}Would you find me some meat or something I can feed to Jareth?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010938	{nl}You can probably hunt some Cockats around here, that should work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010939	You'll see plenty of Cockats in this region.{nl}Thanks for the help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010940	I'm going to need a lot of meat, considering how much Jareth eats.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010941	I think this should be enough.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010942	There's a suspicious trap here.{nl}Remove it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010943	Are you saying the suspicious trap you found was made to attract monsters?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010944	{nl}That has to have been set up by Evoniphon.{nl}Although I'd never heard of a trap like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010945	{nl}We would be in big trouble if one us was caught in that trap.{nl}Thank you for letting us know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010946	I can finally move now, but I'm still really tired and dizzy.{nl}I was wondering if you could bring me some honey from the Pendrosiums.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010947	Wow, thank you, I appreciate it.{nl}But the thing is, you can't just catch the Pendrosiums to get to the honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010948	{nl}There's this scent I use after tiring them out a little.{nl}The Pendrosiums are really sensitive to it; a little whiff and they're knocked out. That's when you get the honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010949	{nl}Just put the honey in bottle.{nl}There's plenty of Pendrosiums wandering around so they shouldn't be hard to find.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010950	I can handle the hunger, but I can't stand being this dizzy...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010951	You filled it all the way up!{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010952	I don't know if the Hunters think all these demons are gathering here because of Evoniphon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010953	{nl}But right now there are just too many demons... I can barely move around.{nl} I'm especially worried about the Infrogalas Mages.{nl}They're too many for me to handle on my own.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010954	It's dangerous out there, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010955	I really think something needs to be done about the Infrogalas Mages.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010956	These demons just keep coming back, don't they?{nl}Still, I feel a little better now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010957	{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010958	I just don't feel quite safe yet, you know.{nl}The energy left behind by the Brambles is still affecting Sirdgela Forest.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010959	{nl}And if the monsters come all the way to Viltis Forest, then there's no way we can stop them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010960	{nl}On the road leading to Sirdgela Forest there's a place called Zvalge Forest Way.{nl}Some time ago I installed a few devices there to stop the demons from advancing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010961	{nl}The monsters didn't let me carry on though, and the devices were never activated.{nl}If only I can activate them now, we wouldn't have to worry about the monsters for a while...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010962	Thank you so much for helping!{nl}The blocking devices are little tricky to activate, though, so let me explain.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010963	{nl}I installed the four devices underground, so you won't see them at first.{nl}The orb will react when it's near the place where they're buried, so you'll know how to find them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010964	{nl}Once you find the devices, you need to turn on all four.{nl}They'll shut down after a while, so you'll have to be quick here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010965	{nl}Only after all the devices are on can they be activated.{nl}There will be monsters around, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010966	If you manage to activate the devices, it will keep the monsters of Sirdgela Forest from advancing here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010967	I'm glad you could activate the devices, that's a big relief to hear.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010968	I believe I've become a little sensitive recently.{nl}I have a strange feeling.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010969	{nl}You've probably noticed all the Loftlems wandering around.{nl}I can't tell why, but the way they're moving seems a little strange.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010970	{nl}I feel as if I'm being watched... I want to make sure, but I'm afraid they will notice if I try to investigate.{nl}Would you face a few Loftlems and bring me anything particular you may find?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010971	Thank you.{nl}My intuition rarely fails, you see.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010972	{nl}Make sure to bring back anything odd you may find.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010973	I'm also curious to know what the Loftlems' structure is like.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010974	So the Loftlems are carrying around strange devices, you say?{nl}Let me have a look.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010975	Hmm, I'm not sure about the device, but it seems to record images through the monsters' eyes.{nl}It also contains some demon energy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010976	{nl}Why would the Loftlems be recording images... And the demon energy... what does this mean?{nl}There may not be a way to eradicate all the Loftlems, but we cannot let them use these devices.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010977	{nl}We must do something about the demon energy.{nl}I do have an idea; would you be willing to help?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010978	I'm thinking we could use something called a Hallucination Stone on the Loftlems.{nl}First, we're going to need Liverwort spores to make the stone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010979	{nl}But remember not to touch live Liverwort.{nl}The vacant lot south of Pakridy Entrance has plenty of dead Liverwort to collect, so I advise you to go there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010980	With the Hallucination Stones, we can make the Loftlems record false images.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010981	That's quite a lot your brought... thank you.{nl}I'll get started on the stone right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010982	The Hallucination Stones are complete.{nl}Not it only needs to be buried in the grounds near the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010983	{nl}Could I ask you to take the Stones and bury them for me?{nl}I'm afraid the monsters will suspect if they notice me doing anything unusual.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010984	You may bury them in three different spots along the road.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010985	I just wonder why they are collecting these images.{nl}They're monsters, what are they possibly doing with them...?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010986	I ought to investigate this further and alert the order.{nl}I'm extremely thankful for your help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010987	Hang on... I can't let the Dico Tomb Thieves find those chests, though.{nl}They get a hold of them, my superiors are gonna kill me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010988	{nl}Oh, I got it! I can just make a few fake chests, they'll never know!{nl}If you got any time on your hands, do you wanna find me some stuff I can put inside?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010989	I'll be here making the chests.{nl}There's a lot of Moyas around here, maybe you can get some rocks or something from them, that'd be perfect.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010990	I hid everything at the Gerove Workshop Site; put the fake chests in a place where they can see it, too.{nl}I'm guessing they'll think they're ours and steal them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010991	Woah, yeah, that's more than enough.{nl}Thanks a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010992	I'm making the fake chests to fool those Dico guys.{nl}Can't let them get their hands on the stuff we have over at the Gerove Workshop Site, ya know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010993	{nl}I'm thinking I should get some "treasures" to plant around the fake chests, too...{nl}Have you seen those Saltisdaughter wands?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010994	{nl}They have some sort of crystals at the end that look hella expensive.{nl}Can you bring me some of those crystals?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010995	Alright, I'm counting on you.{nl}I'll be here preparing the rest of the chests.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010996	I bet you those guys are just gonna take the chests without even looking inside.{nl}It's not like they have the guts to stay more than a few minutes, anyway.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010997	Woah... Are you sure these came from the monster wands?{nl}Bet I could make some nice cash selling this stuff in the market... Thanks, anyway.{nl}I'll take care of the rest.

QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_010999	Do you see the flooded district below the tower?{nl}There's something shiny there and I'm really curious to know what it is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011000	{nl}I think it might be a gem, but my boss is always watching so I can't go down and check.{nl}And I wouldn't dare go down there by myself with all the monsters around.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011001	{nl}If you don't mind, would you go and see what it is?{nl}If it really is a gem, I'll make sure to give you a proper reward.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011002	I think there may be more than one gem, so please look carefully.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011003	Sometimes the guards will find antiques in the petrified city.{nl}It could very well be possible that there are treasures hidden at the Flooded District, too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011004	So the shiny object was an old magic circle?{nl}I don't recall hearing about a magic circle ever existing in the Flooded District.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011005	{nl}I'm guessing it was a magic circle someone started to make a long time ago.{nl}Seeing as it was abandoned, it can't have been very important.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011006	With the way the world is today, we don't get many supplies coming in.{nl}We're constantly short on rations, so the soldiers often need to get food from around the area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011007	{nl}Do you see those chests under the tower{nl}That's where we hide our emergency food supplies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011008	{nl}We can easily see who accesses them from the top of the tower, and the monsters don't know about them, either.{nl}If that's alright, would you bring me a bag of food from there?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011009	{nl}I didn't have anything for breakfast and I'm a little hungry now.{nl}I'm afraid I can't leave my post... Please do me the favor.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011010	Any chest is fine.{nl}I'll warn the other guards.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011011	We find these emergency food supplies useful when our rations are late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011012	This is more than enough!{nl}I'll make sure to share with the other soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011013	Guard Manderson
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011014	As you may know, this entire area was petrified by Ruklys' curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011015	{nl}Many objects lost here are now inside the stomachs of monsters.{nl}Rumor has it they gobbled up a few expensive items as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011016	{nl}Don't ask me how those things are still alive when everything else turned to stone.{nl}In any case, I would really like to find out if the rumors are true, but with my superior right in front...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011017	{nl}If you don't mind, would you check for me?{nl}The Coastal Fortress isn't very far...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011018	If you find anything, make sure to bring it to me immediately.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011019	The Coastal Fortress may be dangerous, but who knows what kind of treasures are still lost there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011020	These are some heavy pouches you brought!
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011021	There doesn't seem to be anything good in here.{nl}There's a ring, but it looks old.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011022	{nl}Oh, there's something engraved in it.{nl}It's a little hard to read...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011023	{nl}Lyshys Beacon Mound?{nl}That's the name of a place... 
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011024	{nl}I wonder what it means.{nl}Would you go there and check?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011025	Lyshys Beacon Mound is in the Coastal Fortress.{nl}The ring could be a sort of key, so make sure to take it with you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011026	If you find any treasures, please don't tell anyone.{nl}We're bound to get in trouble, especially if any robbers find out about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011027	So it was only a meeting place for an illegal trade?{nl}That's very far from what I imagined...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011028	{nl}No treasure, either...{nl}It doesn't sound like much, does it? I should let it go.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011029	{nl}Oh, but do keep this a secret from Rofdel and the other guards.{nl}I wouldn't want them to misunderstand.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011030	Coming all the way up at the start of my shift is the worst.{nl}I'm tired and it's so dangerous out here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011031	Sometimes our rations arrive late and we resort to emergency food supplies.{nl}Of course, the place where we keep them is a secret.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011032	I heard some thieves were looking for expensive items in this area.{nl}Even the guards sometimes find antiques there, can you imagine?
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011033	The hardest thing for me is climbing all the way to the top of the tower.{nl}I just envy the people who work at the bottom, that's all.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011034	I ate some Melatinun meat on my way here, but it must have been toxic.{nl}The monsters took all my food too when they stole my weapons, you see.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011035	{nl}I've been surviving on any scraps of food I've been able to find, but I really shouldn't have eaten that Melatinun meat.{nl}I did ask around and it seems the Melania herbs that grow nearby are detoxifying.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011036	{nl}I need to gather all the strength I can and go find the Davelae, but in this condition...{nl}If you can, please bring me some Melania...
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011037	Welcome.{nl}Oh, I don't believe I've seen you before, adventurer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011038	{nl}There may be few of us, but we are working hard to stop the demons.{nl}That said, we can always use the help of any brave adventurers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20170313_011039	{nl}If you enter this mission, you must protect the Divine Torch from the demons.{nl}This may sound simple, but be careful, as the demons become stronger and stronger over time.
