QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000001	Kedora Alliance Merchant Alta
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000002	I came here since I was worried, but I won't dare to go in there by myself.{nl}That's why I am asking you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000003	I can't just wonder into places like that you know.{nl}There are monsters just sitting there...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000004	There's rumors of the Alembique Legend among the refugees.{nl}I wanted to know the truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000005	{nl}There might be products that the Alliance is looking for...{nl}Since you were going to explore the cave anyways, it's like hitting two Popolions with one stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000006	{nl}I'll give you this book as payment.{nl}It'll be better than going in blind will it not?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000007	Priest Lintas is correcting the contents of the monument.{nl}The process is taking some time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000008	Thanks to you, the monument has been corrected.{nl}We need to check up on the status of Priest Kidas and Brunas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000009	Even with the help, a flechette is nowhere to be found.{nl}I should go back to my master after sorting things out a bit in here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000010	Aquilas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000011	I came here to learn archery but am just running errands finding that blasted arrow...{nl}If I knew that I had to look for arrows. I would not have started this journey...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000012	I mean, this is all because of Lydia Schaffen.{nl}She should have taken her Flechette or whatever if she had used it to kill Ziburynas!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000013	{nl}Who cares if she is a legendary person.{nl}She doesn't know how to look after her things.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000014	{nl}I can't understand my master.{nl}I don't know how I can be forgiven if I find that Flechette or whatever.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000015	{nl}Even if I do somehow agree that it is important... I don't get how reporting on the vegetation is supposed to be important.{nl}Ugh... Not my kind of work.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000016	I'd be really grateful if you'd offer any type of help.{nl}First of all, could you get me some Poppy Bracken, Aily Grass and Pria Flowers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000017	{nl}What do they have to do with the legendary arrow?{nl}I have no idea either.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000018	Stupid Flechette or whatever it's called...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000019	Mechen
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000020	I thought that Aquilas had come to report...{nl}This place is dangerous due to all of the monsters and demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000021	{nl}How about leaving if you don't have any important business.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000022	{nl}Oh?{nl}Ah, you're a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000023	{nl}It seems as if you are curious as to what my apprentices and I are doing here.{nl}Have you heard anything from Aquilas?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000024	{nl}Oh, I am a member of the Astral Tower and sibling to the former leader.{nl}I made a big mistake while Ignas was trying to take control of the Astral Tower.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000025	{nl}Ignas didn't miss out on the opportunity and took over the Astral Tower.{nl}Of course, the rest of the members don't look upon me so kindly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000026	{nl}No matter how I tell them that it was a mistake, they refuse to listen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000027	{nl}That's why I have decided to try and find Lydia Schaffen's Flechette to try and undo my wrongdoings.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000028	{nl}They'll at least pretend to listen if I bring back the Flechette.{nl}I've come to this place as I am almost certain that her Flechette must be in Ziburynas Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000029	{nl}My apprentices and I have been trying to look for the Flechette but there's been no progress.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000030	I see you've gathered it all.{nl}Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000031	{nl}Go to the camp and ask my master if you're wondering why we had to do this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000032	{nl}Well, I'd better start looking at these unremarkable things to find something different.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000033	Hmm... I thank you for your eagerness, but this place is much too dangerous with all of the demons roaming around. {nl}I would appreciate it if you would simply ask my apprentices how they are doing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000034	{nl}Woognis is at the Vilkas Nest, Jenonhas is at Kainen Crossing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000035	Whoa, you scared me! Who are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000036	{nl}The current situation?{nl}I haven't even gone anywhere near the area since I'm too afraid.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000037	{nl}That over there is the Vilkas nest, but how am I supposed to get in there.{nl}I don't know, maybe I'll be able to get there if I cover myself with Vilkas fur...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000038	We'll be put in danger if we go and fight Vilkas near their nest.{nl}There are a lot of Vilkas at Kyrba Lot as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000039	{nl}Why don't we try gathering Vilkas fur over there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000040	There's a lot of Vilkas at Kyrba Lot, so it should be easy enough to get their fur there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000041	I think we'll be able to fool them into thinking we're one of their friends with this amount of fur.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000042	I'm thinking of going to search their nest with this fur all over me.{nl}It's quite large so I don't know how long it will take but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000043	There's no reason for me to decline your offer of help.{nl}Let's go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000044	There doesn't seem to be a Flechette where I checked.{nl}Did you find anything?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000045	{nl}Ah yes...{nl}Nothing...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000046	So my search has resulted in nothing.{nl}You said that you were gathering reports?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000047	{nl}There are two other apprentices.{nl}One is Aquilas and the other is Jenonhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000048	{nl}Aquilas is on the road to Phamer Forest and Jenonhas is at Kainen Crossing.{nl}You said that you've already met Aquilas, so try looking for Jenonhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000049	I'll return after wrapping things up here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000050	Jenonhas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000051	Thank you so much.{nl}I wouldn't have made it if you hadn't come here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000052	Yes, that is correct.{nl}I am looking for the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000053	{nl}If it was something that could have been found so easily, people would have already taken it, don't you think?{nl}This is pointless.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000054	{nl}There are even demons here.{nl}I can't understand my orders this time round.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000055	{nl}I'm going to have to talk about this later.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000056	Everyone is exhausted since they're searching for an arrow that seems to be non-existant.{nl}Especially where there are so many demons roaming around...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000057	{nl}It's all because I am not skilled enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000058	The first Fletcher Master crafted the Flechette for Lydia Schaffen.{nl}Of course I thought about asking the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000059	{nl}But the Fletcher Master and the other members of the Astral Tower... They won't talk to me because they think I am a traitor.{nl}That's why I am not even thinking about it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000060	Of course I would appreciate the help but...{nl}I'm sure that it won't make a difference.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000061	{nl}Don't be too disappointed though.{nl}The Fletcher Master is at the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000062	Fletcher Master
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000063	You said that Mechen asked you to find the Flechette?{nl}You still came to me knowing what kind of person he is correct?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000064	{nl}Of course I might think of helping him if he agrees to return the Flechette after finding it.{nl}However, he'll show his true colors as soon as we find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000065	If you say that, I'll agree to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000066	{nl}This is a recipe for detecting the Flechette.{nl}Take this to Mechen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000067	The Goddess' Ancient Garden...{nl}It will be a long trip.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000068	He gave you a recipe that will allow us to craft equipment that will help us detect the Flechette?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000069	{nl}How did he decide to help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000070	{nl}Ah... 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000071	{nl}I see.{nl}He agreed to help us under the condition of having my life if I do not give the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000072	{nl}I don't think that will be necessary.{nl}I'll take a look at this recipe then...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000073	Mechen is the person who allowed the previous leader for the Astral Tower, his brother, to be taken down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000074	{nl}How can I trust such a person.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000075	The Flechette is said to be crafted from the divine energy of the Goddess.{nl}It says that we have to get the energy of a powerful demon since it will react to their energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000076	I'm worried that he might make us go and find capture a demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000077	You've collected a lot.{nl}Now what we need is...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000078	The recipe says that we need Vilkas essence in order to control the demon's energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000079	My apprentices have gone to different locations to gather Vilkas essence.{nl}Could you please go to Kyrba Lot?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000080	All you have to do is gather Vilkas essence from Kyrba Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000081	We have gathered all of the materials needed to create the detector.{nl}I'll start crafting it then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000082	I've finished crafting the detector.{nl}I'm going to give it to my apprentices to try and find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000083	{nl}I guess it will make it easier to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000084	If you wish to participate in finding the Flechette, please start at Taylie Lot.{nl}The other places will be covered by my apprentices.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000085	{nl}Try using the detector at Taylie Lot at places you think the Flechette might be.{nl}It will react if the Flechette is nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000086	Go to Taylie Lot and look for the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000087	Ah, have you found the Flechette?{nl}It feels a bit abrupt after all that fruitless time we spent searching for it...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000088	{nl}Of course, none of us are Revelators...{nl}Good job.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000089	{nl}Now it's time to take the Flechette to the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000090	Please be careful.{nl}I wish that this would help resolve the misunderstanding between us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000091	This... it is the Flechette that was created by my elders.{nl}I didn't think that Mechen would give it this easily.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000092	{nl}Hmm...{nl}Take this.{nl}Tell him that this is a sort of reward for finding me the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000093	{nl}I don't know how much good it will do for his honor...{nl}But people will at least know how much he went through to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000094	A promise is a promise, so I'll hand it over.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000095	This... it's an Arrow of Proof crafted by the Fletcher Master...{nl}I hope people will listen to me a bit more if I have this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000096	This will help Mechen recover some of his honor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000097	Hello there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000098	{nl}We are apprentices of Maven.{nl}We are rewriting the misinformation that has been spread about the Ruklys incident on this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000099	{nl}These were almost destroyed because of the actions for King Kadumel.{nl}However, King Barynwell decided to cast magic on them to make them unreadable instead.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000100	{nl}We are preparing to undo the magic and make the corrections.{nl}The monsters are stopping us from doing anything though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000101	We will gladly accept any help you can offer us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000102	{nl}First of all, we need to find the documents.{nl}These documents contain instructions on how to dispell transfiguration magic, but they've been scattered due to monster attacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000103	{nl}We were careful in making any further moves since we don't want to provoke any more monster attacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000104	{nl}Please try looking at Othorove Lot first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000105	We need those documents to dispell the magic and correct the information on this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000106	I see that they've all been scattered like this.{nl}Thank you for gathering all of the pages.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000107	{nl}Now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000108	We'll have to find an orb in order to dispell the magic.{nl}The orb will quickly be depleted so we also had a recharging orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000109	The orb will absorb the energy from the recharging orb.{nl}Therefore, you should be able to find where the orb is if you carry this around with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000110	The recharging orb will emmit magic when activated.{nl}The magic will go towards the orb since it will try to absorb it and will glow when it does so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000111	{nl}All you have to do is to find the orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000112	Magic will come out of the recharging orb when it is activated.{nl}You'll be able to find the orb if you follow it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000113	Oh, thank you so much!{nl}Now that we have the orbs...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000114	We have finished all of the preparations required to dispel the magic on King Kadumel's Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000115	You've dealt with the Gosal?{nl}I can't believe that you took that thing on single handed when the three of us...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000116	{nl}You don't seem to be just another traveler for some reason...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000117	Whatever the case may be, the Gosal is gone, so we'll be able to go there.{nl}We'll have to check Tarkha Lot to see what the object is.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000118	This thing that looks like a tree is actually an monument.{nl}This is all because of the spell.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000119	{nl}We'll dispell it with the orb you've recovered for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000120	The monument has now returned to it's original shape.{nl}We'll now find any pieces of misinformation and correct them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000121	We've finished correcting this one, so we'll have to search for other monuments.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000122	{nl}Please, follow me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000123	Here it is.{nl}I will dispell the magic that is cast on the monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000124	I think that the spores from this bracken have caused the paralysis.{nl}I can't dispell the magic in this state.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000125	{nl}We'll have to wait for me to be able to move again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000126	{nl}You can find Mittelly Herbs near Ausne Lot.{nl}Mittelly Herbs are known to cure such issues.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000127	There should be plenty of Mittelly Herbs near Ausne Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000128	{nl}I'm sorry for being so dependant when you simply volunteered to help...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000129	There are people that have started to deny the existance of the Goddesses after they have all disappeared.{nl}I want to help them believe once more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000130	{nl}However...{nl}I lost my faith in people... as well as the Seed...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000131	At this rate...{nl}I am afraid that I might lose all faith in humanity...{nl}Not a good thing for a priest...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000132	Ah, that feels much better.{nl}I don't think it has completely healed me, but it is enough to allow me to dispell the magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000133	All Vaivora's Koru is able to tell us is that Goddess Ausrine is in a mysterious place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000134	What do you think that the mysterious place will look like?{nl}We have more questions than answers...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000135	Goddess Lada is said to be at Seir Rainforest.{nl}The closest place is most likely Arcus Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000136	I suppose I'll be able to meet her if I go to Seir Rainforest?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000137	Will you be so kind as to remove the bracken from the Monument?{nl}I'll be paralyzed once more if you don't do so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000138	{nl}I doubt it will burn because of all the humidity in this area.{nl}Maybe using the dry skin of the Vilkas would be enough to light a proper fire.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000139	If the plague rears it's ugly head once more the people of Kiren Province won't stand a chance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000140	I never even imagined that there would be bracken with paralyzing spores.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000141	{nl}However... I can't imagine that you are just a simple traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000142	I see that all the bracken has burned.{nl}I'll dispell the magic on the Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000143	Hmm... I've checked the Monument, but it seems as if this one doesn't need to be corrected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000144	Ah, you have gathered quite a lot.{nl}I'm sure that they'll burn nicely even in this humidity.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000145	The paralysis doesn't seem to be getting any better.{nl}What should I do...?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000146	Thank you so much.{nl}I'll give you the detector that had allowed me to find the Monuments.{nl}All you need to do is to use it near an object you think might be a Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000147	Use the detector near anything you think might be a Monument.{nl}The detector will let you know it's a Monument by creating a circle around it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000148	You've found a Monument.{nl}I think I am well enough to move now, so let's head over there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000149	I've dispelled the magic and checked what is written on the Monument.{nl}However, it is hard to see what is on it since it has been badly damaged.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000150	There might be fragments nearby.{nl}Could you please check the surrounding area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000151	There should be fragments from the Monument nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000152	Ah, I see that you've collected quite a few fragments.{nl}Let me check those.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000153	I've checked all of the fragments you brought back.{nl}There's a few that have misinformation on them, so please give me a second to correct them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000154	Priest Kidas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000155	Have you come all this way to help?{nl}May you be blessed by the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000156	{nl}Checking the contents of this Monument will be difficult.{nl}As you can see, there are too many vines surrounding it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000157	{nl}Brunas and myself were trying to get rid of the vegetation here, but we couldn't find any useful materials.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000158	{nl}We'd like to use Vilkas salivary glands since they have strong abrasive properties, but getting them is a problem since they won't just give them to us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000159	Getting them to give us the salivary glands is quite hard...{nl}We'll have to wait for them to become weak after attacking them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000160	{nl}You will have to feed them Mytiharyn Grass when they're weakened. This will make them salivate abrasive saliva.{nl}You will have to finish them off now and get the salivary glands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000161	Of course, they might attack you and resist eating the Mytiharyn Grass, so please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000162	The salivary glands you brought should be enough.{nl}However...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000163	We need water to dilute the poison from the salivary glands you brought.{nl}Brunas went to Putas Lot to get the water, but hasn't come back for a while...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000164	I hope everything is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000165	Priest Brunas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000166	Thank you. You saved my life.{nl}Ah, you've collected all of the salivary glands needed?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000167	{nl}We'll be able to get rid of the vegetation once I take this water there then.{nl}I'll hurry back to Kidas then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000168	I've heard that you helped Kidas and Brunas a lot.{nl}Thank you for allowing us to finish our work. It had been stalled for a long time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000169	{nl}I knew I was right in thinking you're not just a normal traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000170	{nl}Whomever you may really be, may you be blessed by the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000171	We are planning on publishing a book with the corrections made to these Monuments in order to allow more people to know about the truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000172	{nl}Please make sure to take a look at the book if you have a chance to do so.{nl}Thank you for all the helped you gave us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000173	This is an area where a plague that caused fevers in people before leading them to their death.{nl}It's a bit quiet at the moment, but we don't know when it'll become worse again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000174	{nl}I'm in the middle of researching that plague.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000175	I might die before I get anywhere near completing a cure if you don't help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000176	I am going to send the cure to the Plague Doctor Master when it is complete.{nl}I will try strengthening it just in case.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000177	Go and see how Woognis is doing at the Vilkas Nest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000178	Something must have happened to Priest Lintas who was dispelling the magic from the monument. Approach him to see what is wrong.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000179	Kidas has removed the vegetation from the Monument and is taking a closer look.{nl}It seems to be taking much longer than expected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000180	You've come back.{nl}I heard that you saved Brunas from monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000181	{nl}I thank you for helping us gather all of the ingredients and saving Brunas.{nl}We finished diluting the poison while you were coming back.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000182	{nl}We'll correct any misinformation on the Monument after removing the vegetation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000183	There was misinformation on the Monument, so we corrected it.{nl}We're going to go back and report to Lintas about our success here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000184	{nl}Thank you for helping us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000185	I am grateful to all of my apprentices who followed me all the way here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000186	I feel sorry that I haven't been able to teach them properly because of my mistakes and poor decisions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000187	I followed him to learn archery, not about shrubs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000188	Here I am ripping weeds out instead of at the archery range.{nl}I am seriously considering just going back home.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000189	I told him that I don't want to pick at weeds anymore and he told me to wait here.{nl}I hope he won't tell me to go and gather leaves next.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000190	I feel like I'll forget how to lose how to hold a bow.{nl}I should go and ask him to teach me archery instead of how to get rid of weeds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000191	I always picked on Jenonhas because of his direct way of communication.{nl}It seems like that we won't have to pick any more weeds thanks to him though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000192	They say that a person called Ignas became the leader of the Astral Tower because of a mistake he made.{nl}What sort of mistake gets the leader of the Astral Tower changed?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000193	We followed him because we wished to learn archery.{nl}However, all he is doing is trying to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000194	It is pretty much impossible to find an arrow in this large area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000195	Jenonhas and Aquilas have a lot of resentment at the moment.{nl}Of course, Aquilas would rather keep his complaints under wraps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000196	Jenonhas on the other hand, is much more direct and forthcoming.{nl}I'm actually sort of amazed that he didn't say anything up to this point.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000197	Jenonhas and Aquilas are as tired out as I am with this fruitless search.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000198	There was a time when I asked him about what mistake he made to buy the wrath of the Astral Tower members.{nl}He didn't answer me at the time and looked into the distance while sighing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000199	It is said that Lydia Schaffen had defeated the Demon King Ziburynas in this forest with the Flechette.{nl}However, Lydia Schaffen hadn't retrieved that fantastic arrow after that feat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000200	{nl}Why didn't Lydia Schaffen retrieve her arrow?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000201	I tried my best to find the Flechette thinking that it would help him recover his honor.{nl}However, I was threatened by monsters and demons the whole time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000202	{nl}I thought that I might lose my life while trying to regain his honor.{nl}That's why I went to talk about the current situation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000203	{nl}I don't care if this will reflect poorly on me.{nl}It is better than watching my colleagues die trying to find an arrow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000204	I don't understand the Astral Tower's reaction to him either.{nl}Of course, I don't know what his mistake was but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000205	{nl}They are said to have gone through a lot together...{nl}I think that the members of the Astral Tower should forgive him now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000206	How sad do you think a Master would be if one of his apprentices lost their honor.{nl}Maven must have been extremely sad watching on as Ruklys lost his honor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000207	I am going to continue Maven's work by letting the people know the truth about Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000208	I will correct the misunderstandings that have been plaguing the Kingdom since King Kadumel's time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000209	This must be done no matter how hard it is to make people take another look at Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000210	Rewriting the history regarding Ruklys is needed in order to correct the misinformation that is included in our history.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000211	Kidas and myself would have done our part once we check and correct this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000212	We will correct the misinformation about Ruklys by correcting this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000213	Ohla
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000214	Hello there!{nl}Have you seen my daughter by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000215	{nl}She has twin-tails and is wearing a hood.{nl}Her name's Liel.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000216	{nl}She disappeared without saying anything...{nl}I thought she had gone to a friend's house and checked there but there was no trace of her there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000217	{nl}I think she may have gone out of the Refugee Camp.{nl}I've tried asking people to help, but nobody seem to be willing to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000218	{nl}I know that it's asking a lot with the monsters threatening everyone but...{nl}I've come out since I was so worried but there doesn't seem to be anything I can do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000219	If there was anywhere I thought she might be, I would have gone there already...{nl}I guess we should try looking for places nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000220	{nl}Could you please try looking at Preivhengikas Felled Area?{nl}Where could she have gone with all of these monsters crawling around...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000221	She's my only daughter and family since I lost my husband during Medzio Diena.{nl}She's all I have in this world now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000222	{nl}Please, find Liel for me...{nl}Please...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000223	I don't know what my mother is thinking...{nl}Not even knowing that I left to get her some wool so she won't catch any more colds...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000224	{nl}The fact that I couldn't do anything for her and that she had to go to...{nl}I am so sorry...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000225	Thank the Goddess...{nl}I already don't know how to repay you for saving my daughter...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000226	{nl}But you're offering to even get the wool...{nl}I don't know how I am to repay you for your generousity...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000227	There's an insect called the White Tree Forest Moth...{nl}It's cacoons are known to be around here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000228	{nl}Liel used to go and gather them to use as silk.{nl}I don't know where she hears these things...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000229	{nl}I know she's my daughter, but isn't she resourceful?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000230	I'm just sorry that I can't offer her more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000231	We're searching this area for a Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000232	I think that this should be enough to stitch the tent back up.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000233	Curtis
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000234	Ah, you must be the person who saved that girl, Liel.{nl}The way you simply dealed with the monsters that several young men weren't able to tackle...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000235	{nl}Ah, look at me... I've forgetten to introduce myself.{nl}My name's Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000236	{nl}I'm just another refugee who lost his family and home during Medzio Diena and is trying to get by.{nl}I don't think that coming here helped matters at all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000237	{nl}It's difficult getting things that are needed for basic survival.{nl}That means there are more conflicts between the refugees as well as theives...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000238	{nl}We've tried to make some rules and set up defences against the monsters that keep attacking us but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000239	We were in dire need of help.{nl}If you're capable of saving Liel, I'm sure you're more than able to help us a bit more!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000240	{nl}I know we might seem a tad ungrateful, but please...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000241	{nl}There are many who haven't had a proper meal for a long time.{nl}We've lost the farmland that we took so much care of...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000242	{nl}We need something to settle that hunger more than anything.{nl}Could you please get us some Flowlevi head flower?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000243	{nl}When dried the seeds come out.{nl}We can cook them
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000244	The monsters in this area are a bit more fierce since they are all starving.{nl}Please don't try to bite off more than you can chew and just run if you think it's a bit too much.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000245	Many people will have full stomaches today thanks to the food you've brought back.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000246	Monsters have been attacking us much more frequently.{nl}That's why we've put up those walls and distributed any weapons we could find to the young men.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000247	{nl}The walls keep the monsters at bay, but we're worried that they aren't strong enough.{nl}They seem to break whenever monsters decide to start rampaging.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000248	{nl}We're repairing them with wood each time.{nl}What I'm saying is that we use a lot of wood just repairing the walls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000249	Go to Saughus Lot with the tools I gave you.{nl}You'll be able to get a lot of good materials there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000250	{nl}After gathering some wood there, you'll be able to make some repair kits for the walls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000251	The problem was that the walls were weak since nobody had any knowledge on how to make them.{nl}They break down every time monsters decide to attack us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000252	{nl}That's why we have to keep repairing them every day.{nl}Of course that means we need a lot of wood as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000253	This should be enough for one repair session.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000254	I'll distribute the wood you've gathered to allow the repairs to start.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000255	I know we've asked a lot, but please...{nl}All you need to do is to repair the wall in front of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000256	The rest will be repaired by the other people.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000257	We could have scraped by and repaired the walls but...{nl}I had no idea that you would help us so generously.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000258	Mishekan Forest is extremely cold at night.{nl}You'll catch frostbites if you don't wrap up tightly enough at night.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000259	{nl}That's why we need a lot of clothes or covers that use Flowlon leathers.{nl}Of course it isn't easy for us to deal with the monsters in the first place...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000260	This place is cold enough at night to make you shiver non-stop.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000261	I think this will be enough for all the people here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000262	The worst part of this place is the lack of water.{nl}We did manage to set up a few wells here and there...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000263	{nl}We haven't been able to drink it after the poison from the White Trees managed to trickle into the water supply.{nl}We've had to purify the water in one way or another.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000264	{nl}We are using a grass called Randulin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000265	I'll give you a bottle of water.{nl}The problem is that Randulin usually is well hidden beneath the earth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000266	{nl}However, it will turn yellow when touched by the un-purified water here.{nl}You'll be able to see where the Randulin is by sprinkling the ground with this water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000267	A lot of people suffered greatly when we didn't know about the issues with the water.{nl}Aurlelse who is good with herbs, taught people how to purify the water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000268	Yes.{nl}What you have brought is indeed Randulin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000269	{nl}I think that will allow us to drink purified water for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000270	Did I tell you about the farmland that we had worked on?{nl}We had used the cable-car here in order to create arable land over at Lacetti Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000271	{nl}Even if it's a bit far from here, there's a lot of sunlight as well as soft soil.{nl}But we always had to be prepared to fix the old and worn cable-car since it was the only way for use to get there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000272	{nl}That's why we prepared tools to fix it at a moments notice in a pouch and place it somewhere we could find easily.{nl}The monsters mistook them for food bags and stole them all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000273	Monsters must have been starving too.{nl}Taking something they cannot eat...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000274	Ah, yes.{nl}Those are the pouches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000275	There's still a problem left even if we are able to repair the cable-car again.{nl}As soon as we tilled the soil at Phavegheliai, monsters started attacking us there as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000276	{nl}This is a matter of our survival.{nl}People will start starving if monsters are allowed to control that land for too long.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000277	{nl}That's why I'm gathering young men to go and drive them off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000278	I knew that it wouldn't be something that a handful of people could accomplish...{nl}I believe that you'll manage to tip things in our favor even more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000279	Phavegheliai Farm will be on the other end of the cable-car that you get on at Lacetti Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000280	Liel...Are you there Liel?{nl}Where could she have gone to...{nl}I told her to not go out of the Refugee Camp...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000281	If you see a girl with a hood that has twin-tails, please bring her here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000282	I'm looking for a girl with a hood and twin-tails.{nl}Her name is Liel. Have you seen her?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000283	If you do find her, please bring her back to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000284	Phavegheliai Farm was nothing but grasslands.{nl}It seemed perfect since there wasn't too many monsters and the sunlight was good here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000285	{nl}That's why we started to farm here and the crops made it well.{nl}Then, the monsters came after the crops and we lost control of the farm.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000286	It seems like we'll be able to farm again thanks to you.{nl}I suppose it would be too much to ask you to stay with us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000287	{nl}Why don't you meet the people before you leave...{nl}I'm sure they'll have plenty to say to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000288	You've listened to all of the worries of the people here?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000289	{nl}I'm sure there wasn't one story that wasn't heartbreaking.{nl}Some feel like life here is nothing but trouble.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000290	{nl}Some people say that I don't know about the severity of this situation, but I assure you that I do.{nl}This type of life will not be sustainable without material help from someone else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000291	{nl}I am sorry for the children as they will not be able to see the outside world.{nl}I have of course considered moving somehwere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000292	{nl}However, we don't know exactly where we are in the Great Woodlands so we can't simply pick a direction either.{nl}We don't have enough food or supplies and the monsters are a never ending threat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000293	Really?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000294	{nl}Thank you.{nl}We would appreciate it if you could go to a major city for help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000295	I see that there are refugees that haven't been able to receive proper assistance.{nl}I shall ask the lords near Mishekan if they can't offer some help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000296	How did it go?{nl}Is there a city willing to help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000297	The Knight Commander at Klaipeda said that he'd request help from the other lords?{nl}That's just what I wanted to hear.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000298	{nl}Thank you so much for going the extra bit for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000299	I shall ask the lords near Mishekan Forest to aid the refugees.{nl}I'll try to make them hurry a bit as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000300	Aurlelse
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000301	I think of the peaceful days before Medzio Diena every day.{nl}The Potato Dumplings I used to have with my wife were the best...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000302	I lost my wife to a large branch that crashed on top of the house that day.{nl}I am regretful that I wasn't even able to properly bury her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000303	Alex
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000304	I am also afraid that I'll be attacked like Mr. Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000305	{nl}He was attacked by monsters a while ago when trying to drive them out of town.{nl}I can still see him in pain because of the wounds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000306	If it wasn't for Medzio Diena, I would have married my love and be living a happy life...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000307	Wickens
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000308	It wasn't too long after I came here.{nl}Waltas was stealing for his wife and baby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000309	{nl}He used to be someone that always looked out for other people...{nl}I realized that people change in harsh circumstances after seeing that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000310	I do somewhat understand why Waltas was stealing.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000470	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will start with the legends of Alembique.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000471	Chapter 1 Legends of Alembique{nl}-{nl}There are tales of a cave named Alembique{nl}in the southern province of Kiren.{nl}{nl}It is said that a brilliant alchemist{nl}created many invaluable goods{nl}and occasionally invited people{nl}to show off to them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000472	Nobody seems to know the location{nl}of the mysterious Alembique Cave.{nl}{nl}However, older people in several villages{nl}tell their descendants of being invited to the cave,{nl}and not wanting to leave the place{nl}as they had experienced never before seen luxuries.{nl}{nl}Therefore, people from these villages{nl}have a habit of congratulating any people that have gone missing{nl}and hope that they will also be invited one day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000473	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 2
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000474	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will now go on to the hidden Royal Mausoleum.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000475	Chapter 2 : Legends of the Hidden Royal Mausoleum{nl}-{nl}The Great Woodlands have been used by the nobles and public alike{nl}as hunting grounds or refuge thanks to their lush vegetation.{nl}As such, it is an inevitability that people have experience.{nl}However, the funny thing is{nl}there is no account related to the royal family.{nl}According to some rumors,{nl}the reason for lack of accounts is because after Taniel II era.{nl}Many offerings were buried in the secret mausoleum.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000476	What I am saying is that{nl}the Royalty seemed to leave this place alone{nl}as there was a secret place here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000477	To be frank, record of Taniel the Second's funeral{nl}are extremely sparse{nl}which lends extra credibility to these claims.{nl}That is because the other funerals{nl}had some sort of records{nl}no matter how small.{nl}However, even if these claims are true{nl}the Mausoleum will never see the light of day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000478	The location of the secret mausoleum remains hidden{nl}for it is almost impossible to avoid{nl}the gaze of  Goddess Medeina.{nl}That is why even if the rumors are true, it is likely that it will remain just a legend.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000479	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 3
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000480	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will continue with the legends of the Golden Veins of Barconsi.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000481	Chapter 3 : The Golden Veins of Barconsi{nl}-{nl}There are tales that there is a legendary gold vein{nl}in the rural mountains of the Kingdom.{nl}It is said that a demon had found this vein{nl}and a hero defeated the demon before claiming it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000482	It is also said that the hero{nl}only took the vein to prevent the demon from using it{nl}and had no interest in using it for himself.{nl}That is why he buried the location forever.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000483	The hero eventually passed away from old age{nl}and left no children leaving the gold{nl}up for anyone to take if they could find it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000484	However, there is something suspicious{nl}about this legend.{nl}There is no record of Barconsi,{nl}the hero who supposedly took the gold from the demon{nl}in any of the Kingdom's records.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000485	As such, many people believe that{nl}this legend is fictional{nl}as there is no record of Barconsi.{nl}However, they do not try to explain{nl}why Barconsi's name is involved.{nl}Of course, there are also many people{nl}that keep searching for the gold.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000486	Refugee Brandon
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000487	I should have listened when everyone was telling me off!{nl}This forest is dangerous!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000488	I don't understand why that hunter would want to keep this forest for himself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000489	Umm, could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000490	{nl}I barely managed to get out of a trap, but I hurt my leg and can't go any further.{nl}Please help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000491	There's some Whitetailed Grass at Turas Lot... They say it will relieve pain.{nl}I think I'll manage to walk if I'm chewing on that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000492	There should be some in the surrounding area.{nl}Could you get some for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000493	Thank you so much.{nl}I'm going to get out of here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000494	{nl}There seems to be a violent hunter that wants to claim this land as his own.{nl}I doubted that until I got caught in one of his traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000495	{nl}From what I've heard, he's known to have tamed a beast in order to chase people off...{nl}You should avoid getting any deeper into the forest as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000496	I thought you were simply a nosy adventurer, but you seem to be a cut above the rest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000497	Let me introduce myself.{nl}My name is Vilhelmas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000498	{nl}I used to be a member... Actually, let's forget about the past since it's not important.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000499	{nl}Emmet Forest has only been recently discovered.{nl}It seems like a good place for refugees, so I was getting rid of the troublesome monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000500	{nl}There's also a beast here...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000501	{nl}You know, the rumors are mostly true... Apart from those about me of course.{nl}I am on my way to get rid of that beast.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000502	I appreciate the thought but... I'll have to see your skill before I'll allow it.{nl}I don't want there to be your blood on my hands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000503	Their saying that I tamed the beast to chase people off?{nl}That's really disheartening...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000504	I never thought you would be a Revelator...{nl}Maybe the fact that you came here was also a plan of a Goddess or two.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000505	I thought that you were skilled, but never thought that you were a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000506	As I told you before, this is a good place for people to live.{nl}This means that this is a good place for the refugees from the Old Capital.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000507	{nl}First of all, the Kugheri must be removed in order for people to settle here.{nl}But we'll have to deal with the beast before we can tackle the Kugheri.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000508	{nl}I was getting tired of tracking him because of the curse anyways.{nl}I'd appreciate it if you could help me a bit...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000509	{nl}Of course, the beast is more than capable, which means that there will be casualties if you're not strong enough.{nl}Would you mind if I test your skills?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000510	It wasn't long after I started dealing with the Kugheri.{nl}One of the demons came crashing through Emmet Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000511	{nl}I don't care what a demon would come here for.{nl}I simply took care of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000512	{nl}It was relatively easy defeating it.{nl}But there were complications.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000513	{nl}He cursed me when he was cornered.{nl}My sight is severely hindered due to that stupid curse.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000514	{nl}Anyways, he put a red gem through himself after that.{nl}He started to transform after that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000515	{nl}I'm sure you might have guessed from listening up to this point, but the beast is the demon.{nl}I realized at once that the demon was much more dangerous than before.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000516	{nl}Of course, he had a bit of fear left for me and ran as well.{nl}The long and boring fight between the two of us has been dragging on ever since then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000517	{nl}Tracking that thing with this curse wasn't easy.{nl}Having limited vision as a hunter is  almost a death sentance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000518	{nl}I put up warnings to ward people away but refugees kept coming in despite of my efforts.{nl}I think I'll be able to settle this fight once and for all with your help though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000519	{nl}Please, lend me your strength.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000520	Very good.{nl}Try dealing with the Kugheri of this forest.{nl}If you are able to deal with them, you might be good enough to take on the beast with me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000521	Please prove your skills by dealing with the Kugheri.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000522	Hmm... You are definitely skilled.{nl}I think I'll be able to defeat the beast if I fight with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000523	{nl}You're a bit too good...{nl}You're not just the average traveler are you? What are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000524	So you're the...!{nl}Now I understand your skill.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000525	{nl}Well then Revelator, you should help me out with a problem I have here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000526	I think we'll give that idea a try since I have someone to help me now.{nl}I think we'll be able to critically injure the beast.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000527	{nl}The plan is to plant a trap where he normally travels and then for me to hit the beast with a poison arrow.{nl}I'll have to gather ingredients for the poison, but I can't do this alone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000528	{nl}The first ingredient for the poison can be taken from the Kugheri.{nl}I can't see them until I get near them, but they run if I get too close.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000529	{nl}Could you gather the ingredients for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000530	Thank you.{nl}You'll be able to get the poison from Kugheri Tots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000531	{nl}They seem to have poison for protection purposes when they're young, but simply taking that poison won't be enough.{nl}The poison will become much more potent if you spray them with this stimulant.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000532	{nl}Defeat them and bring me the enhanced poison sacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000533	Approach the Kugheri Tots and defeat them after spraying them with stimulant.{nl}Take the poison sacks from them after defeating them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000534	Good job.{nl}You'll have to move with me for the next ingredient.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000535	The next ingredient is the Yellow Wolfsbane.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000536	{nl}However, we can't use any flower.{nl}Only a professional will be able to see which flower can be used.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000537	{nl}I'll decide which flowers can be used since you won't be able to tell the difference.{nl}All you have to do is lead me to the flowers since I can't see where they are.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000538	They should be growing near Saalmas Falls.{nl}We should get moving at once.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000539	Thank you.{nl}I'll start mixing the poison.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000540	We have enough ingredients for the poison now.{nl}However...{nl}I seem to be fresh out of materials for the traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000541	{nl}The Kugheri Sommi always carry paralysis poison to use on small animals.{nl}It can be used on larger targets if you have enough of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000542	{nl}Could you gather the poison from them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000543	Thank you.{nl}I'll be making other preparations.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000544	Bring me paralysis poison gathered from the Kugheri Sommi.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000545	That took longer than expected.{nl}Let's go and finish the trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000546	We're all set to go.{nl}I just have to install this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000547	I tracked the beast and mixed the poison while you were gathering the poison for the trap.{nl}He leaves a red trail behind him. It may be a bit faint for you to see.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000548	{nl}I think it's because of the red gem he put through himself.{nl}Anyways, I found a small trail where he frequently goes by.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000549	{nl}I think we should install the trap on the way up to Saalmas Falls from Tredhalai Stream.{nl}I'll be hiding at Visuobene Falls and hit him with the poison arrow as soon as he is trapped.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000550	{nl}It should be enough to critically injure the beast.{nl}All you have to do is install the trap where I just described.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000551	Make sure to install it exactly where I described.{nl}I won't be able to hit him if it's not in the correct place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000552	Go and install the trap before the beast goes through.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000553	I'll have to rest here for a bit.{nl}Vaighe Hill is a dead end so we won't have to worry too much. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000554	{nl}You'll have to end it by yourself.{nl}It should have been weakened considerably because of the poison arrow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000555	Don't worry about me and go after it!{nl}Before it can recover!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000556	He's gone to a dead end.{nl}This is the opportune moment to finish it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000557	We should recover all of the traps we set to catch the beast.{nl}We can't have people like you stepping on them now can we?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000558	May the Goddess bless your journey.{nl}I hope you will be able to succeed in your mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000559	I won't be caught out by the Kugheri even if I am wounded.{nl}Hurry after him and finish the job.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000560	Yes...{nl}The long fight has finally come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000561	{nl}I don't know when this would have ended if it wasn't for you.{nl}I think my eyesight is returning now that the beast is gone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000562	{nl}I owe you.{nl}I would appreciate it if you could stay behind and help me clean this place up...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000563	{nl}I'm sure you have your mission as Revelator.{nl}I don't know how I'll repay you for the help you gave.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000564	{nl}Farewell then.{nl}I wish you the best on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000565	Anyone who goes beyond this point will put their life at risk.{nl}Go back while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000566	I advise you to be careful as there are violent Kugheri and armed traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000567	Refugee Mylija
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000568	I came here after hearing that it was okay, but I think it was a bad decision on my part.{nl}Monsters are crawling everywhere... People are fighting amongst each other...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000569	I can't beliece that it's been four years since Medzio Diena and they're still fighting over stupid land.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000570	At least they're talking to each other instead of simply fighting.{nl}I wish we could know who to rely on soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000571	I hope that everything will be finished without bloodshed.{nl}I'm a bit worried that there may be complications since they don't exactly have a good history together.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000572	I am thankful that the argument is over since they've decided to help us even if they haven't decided the winner.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000573	Thank you for your help Traveler.{nl}This was all thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000574	Ah, it's you...{nl}Could you help us out?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000575	{nl}The food we've brought with us is long gone...{nl}We've asked the lords supposed to be ruling this region, but they are too busy squabbling between themselves to help us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000576	{nl}Since you seem to be capable of dealing with some monsters, we have no choice but to ask you...{nl}Could you please gather some tailfruit from the Yellow Leafnuts after dealing with them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000577	Thank you.{nl}I think all that's left to eat around these parts are the tailfruits from the Leafnuts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000578	Please gather some tailfruit from the Yellow Leafnuts in the surrounding area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000579	Thank you so much.{nl}We'll manage for a while with these but... I hope that they'll decide who will rule this region as soon as possible...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000580	Refugee Greg
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000581	We came all the way here for help but have to fend for ourselves...{nl}This makes this place exactly like anywhere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000582	How could they be squabbling over land in such situations...{nl}I guess I can't expect any better from nobles can I...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000583	Well, at least they're better than the average noble.{nl}It seems like they've caught on to the situation after being attacked by monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000584	I heard that you were the reason behind their sudden agreement.{nl}I don't know how I will repay you for this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000585	Monsters are attacking us refugees a few times every single day.{nl}What's the use of having a lot of soldiers nearby.{nl}They're all busy protecting their lords.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000586	{nl}Even worse, they don't care if the refugees here die or not.{nl}All they seem to care about is getting more land under their boots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000587	{nl}That's why we have to look for ways to look after ourselves.{nl}I'm sorry, but could you please get us some strong branches from the nearby area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000588	{nl}We're planning on having them as weapons.{nl}I will have to stay here in order to carve their points to use as weapons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000589	Thank you so much for offering your help.{nl}We've already taken this much from the surrounding area, so you'll have to look over at Collegia Crossing for more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000590	{nl}There's always monsters near branches, so please be careful out there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000591	Be wary of monsters when collecting branches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000592	Thank you.{nl}They all look very sturdy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000593	{nl}However, they are still just tree branches... We won't last long with these.{nl}We need the fighting between the two lords to end soon...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000594	{nl}Only the Goddess will know if they'll care about us even if it does end soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000595	I saw you helping Greg.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000596	{nl}I've seen you helping us out and dealing with monsters with ease...{nl}You don't seem to be just an ordinary traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000597	{nl}We... we'll have to leave this place if the lords don't stop arguing soon.{nl}However, we are afraid of going into Emmet Forest because of the warnings and strange rumors about the place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000598	{nl}In other words, we don't have anywhere to go.{nl}So, please, could you find it in your heart to go and mediate?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000599	You'll help us right?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000600	{nl}Ah, thank the Goddesses...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000601	{nl}I'm sure that you'll manage to persuade them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000602	{nl}Lord Ryudhas is ruling over the land in place of his sick brother.{nl}He is a very stubborn man.{nl}He's staying at Dhuvus Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000603	{nl}Lord Joquvas is a young lad who has recently come into power.{nl}He is at Nevhrandi Crossroads with his tutor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000604	{nl}We always get turned away every time we go near them.{nl}Please go and talk some sense into them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000605	Lord Ryudhas is at Dhuvus Lot,{nl}Lord Joquvas is at Nevhrandi Crossroads.{nl}Please convince them to stop arguing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000606	That was incredible!{nl}I didn't think that you'd be able to convince both of them...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000607	Lord Ryudhas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000608	Not anyone can simply go and talk to a lord.{nl}That has not changed despite how the rest of the world has changed since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000609	I am currently running my family's business in my brother's place as he is ill.{nl}I will not ignore anyone who is threatening my family's rule.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000610	You have my word since you have dutifully carried out the tasks I have set for you.{nl}I will attempt to talk to Joquvas.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000615	The reason I am fighting with the Joquvas lad?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000616	{nl}It's not even really a fight.{nl}I am simply notifying him of my family's right.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000617	{nl}I have in my possession an official document that proves my right to the land here.{nl}That miserable lad is merely being a nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000618	{nl}I am not as compromising as my brother.{nl}This is the rightful land of the Ryudhas family.{nl}I will not back down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000619	I was wondering what sort of nonsense you would tell me.{nl}Why do I need to talk to the lad about my rightful land?

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000628	Another ingredient is needed to craft the medicine. The legs of the Orange Grummer.{nl}Of course, you'll need to forcefully take it from them, so it may be too much for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000629	{nl}Of course, I can simply give this task to another person if you don't want to do it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000630	Hmm... I am surprised.{nl}I don't know who you are, but why are you working so hard for the refugees?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000631	{nl}Well, whatever the case, fine.{nl}If you have decided to accept the task, go fetch me the Orange Grummer legs.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000651	You must go through me if you have anything to say to Lord Joquvas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000652	I have taught our lord since he was young.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000676	That is... a shield.{nl}I can confirm that there is a seal of the Joquvas family on it.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000697	Yes... This is not the time for us to argue over the land.{nl}We must stand together and fight back the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000698	It is as you have told me.{nl}We will be able to focus on ruling our land since the boundaries have been set.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000705	{nl}You have done well as mediator.{nl}I give my word that I will take care of the refugees.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000706	I don't like the results, but what can be done?{nl}The Ryudhas also had some good points in their arguements.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000707	The Kugheri Tribe and demons...{nl}Investigating Syla Forest has become much more dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000708	What I am attempting to do has the lives of many people on the line.{nl}However, it is... extremely difficult. I would appreciate it if I could get some help but...

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000715	{nl}My name is Indraja, an adventurer.{nl}I have received a request to go and investigate places where the refugees might stay while the Kingdom is being reconstructed.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000734	We knew that they didn't like humans, but we didn't know that they would attack us with such numbers.{nl}They must have made an agreement with the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000735	{nl}They are sure to be searching for us nearby.{nl}Please reduce their numbers a bit.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000736	General Lhamin is trying to reconstruct the Kingdom.{nl}He wishes to utilize anything possible to do so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000737	{nl}He had come across a legend that had been passed down by Royalty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000738	{nl}It is said that Taniel the Second had created another Royal Mausoleum.{nl}It is said that much information was stored there to prepare for some sort of catastrophe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000739	{nl}The General firmly believes that the information stored there will be of great help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000740	{nl}It is said that you must be of Royal descent in order to find the Royal Mausoleum's entrance.{nl}That's why I have been honorably chosen as a far relative of the Royalty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000741	{nl}However, I never thought that the demons would be searching for the Royal Mausoleum as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000742	{nl}There were two demons, but I spread misinformation and made one to to Emmet Forest.{nl}The other followed us here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000743	{nl}We wouldn't have been able to continue on our mission if we hadn't met you here.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000745	Thank you.{nl}However, we won't be able to rest easy until we deal with the demon behind them.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000747	{nl}...{nl}These are the orders from the demon!

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000749	I wasn't able to decipher the orders you brought me.{nl}I am sure that there are more orders...

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000751	Thank you. You said that you gathered them from the Kugheri Zabbi?{nl}Please get me more of them from the Kugheri Zabbi on the road to Stabhas Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000752	The Kugheri Zabbi should have more orders.{nl}I might be able to make some sense of it with more references.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000753	Thank you.{nl}I'll try to figure out what the demon was scheming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000754	I've looked at all of the material you brought me.{nl}Where to begin...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000755	{nl}It is said that the demon going after the Royal Mausoleum is called Vhalterris.{nl}Unlike his colleague, he has been chasing us quite cleverly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000756	{nl}Marcus allowed us to both escape but...{nl}We lost a chest related to the Royal Mausoleum's secret.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000757	{nl}According to these orders, it seems as if he has yet to unravel the secret held within that chest.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000763	{nl}We will only be able to find the entrance if we solve various puzzles.{nl}The chest you brought back is the start of the puzzles.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000767	{nl}It is said to be part of a set with the box and will react to the trees there.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000809	Good job.{nl}However, there are still some Kugheri that had followed Vhalterris.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001327	Passendes Holz für die Reparatur der Palisaden fertigen
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001328	Curtis meint, dass Pfahlpalisaden zum Schutz der Flüchtlinge errichtet wurden. Dies geschah jedoch in zu großer Eile und jetzt müssten sie bereits repariert werden. Finde gutes Holz und Werkzeug, um geeignetes Material für die Reparatur der Palisaden zu fertigen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001329	Die Palisaden reparieren
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001330	Repariere die Palisaden mit dem Holz.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001331	Du hast alle Palisaden repariert. Frage Curtis, ob du sonst noch irgendwie helfen kannst.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001332	Blumlon-Leder sammeln
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001333	Die Nächte im Mischekan-Wald sind kalt. Deshalb fertigen die Flüchtlinge Kleidung und Decken aus Blumlon-Leder. Blumlons sind nicht aggressiv. Beschaffe Leder von Blumlons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001334	Du hast genug Leder besorgt. Bringe es jetzt Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001335	Randuline sammeln
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001336	Curtis meint, dass die weißen Bäume Gift absondern. Das Gift ist ins Grundwasser gelangt und nun kann man es nicht mehr trinken. Randuline wäre jedoch perfekt dafür geeignet, das Gift zu neutralisieren. Benetze den Boden mit vergiftetem Wasser, damit sich das Randuline gelb färbt und du es erkennen und sammeln kannst.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001337	Du hast jetzt genug Randuline eingesammelt. Kehre zu Curtis zurück.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001338	Sprich mit Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001339	Die Säcke mit Seilbahn-Ersatzteilen zurückholen
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001340	Die Seilbahn ist bereits viel zu betagt und anfällig für die verschiedensten Probleme. Die für die Reparatur benötigten Teile befinden sich in Säcken, die von Monstern geklaut wurden. Besiege die Monster und hole sie dir zurück.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001341	Du hast alle Seilbahn-Ersatzteile zurückgeholt. Kehre mit ihnen zu Curtis zurück. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001342	Durch das Besiegen von Monstern Folgendes zurückholen: %s

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_001348	Du hast einige Dokumente zurückgeholt.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001349	Jugrinas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001350	Uh...? Are you here because of the warning...?{nl}No, let us talk later.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001351	{nl}First, take this medicine, quick.{nl}This area is being affected by the dangerous Nobreer epidemic!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001352	{nl}Even the Plague Doctor Master has been unable to identify the source of the epidemic.{nl}It was discovered in the residents of Nobreer Forest after Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001353	{nl}Falling ill means you can end in a slow, torturous death.{nl}Take it before it's too late, hurry!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001354	I hope it won't be too late.{nl}The medicine is not yet complete, you see.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001355	As of now it is more of a preventative drug, rather than a cure.{nl}It won't have any effect if you are already ill, so please hurry and take it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001356	If you feel feverish or dizzy, even a little... Please, let me know.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001357	I'm glad you seem to be safe.{nl}My name is Jugrinas.{nl}I'm a Plague Doctor and I'm researching the Nobreer epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001358	{nl}As I mentioned earlier, the epidemic was first found in refugee groups.{nl}The Plague Doctor Master was only able to stop it from spreading, but no more than that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001359	{nl}After progress slowed down, Cicas and I were sent here by the Master to research the disease.{nl}Unfortunately, we missed the right time to take the medicine and fell ill.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001360	{nl}Someone should be replacing us soon, as we find it too difficult to move the patients.{nl}I simply regret having to go back with no results.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001361	{nl}Thinking about all the patients still suffering from horrible pain, I...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001362	Will you really?{nl}I'm terribly sorry to ask since it's our first time meeting but...{nl}I will accept your favor, for the good of the patients.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001363	I left a few containers near the entrance of Emmet Forest with a solution that absorbs airborne substances.{nl}If any are connected to the disease, they'll have been absorbed by it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001364	Will you bring me some of that testing solution?{nl}I left a few spread around the area, so you may collect a little from each container.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001365	I just hope there'll be substances worth analyzing in the testing solution...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001366	You're back.{nl}Let me have a look.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001367	Hmm... I don't see anything worthy of note.{nl}It seems the disease isn't caused by any airborne substances...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001368	It's a bit time-consuming, but I'm afraid I have no choice but to use the Pandemic Detectors.{nl}It's a device created by the Plague Doctor Master to detect the disease's energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001369	It was meant to be used to find patients but... I figure we can use it to find the source of the disease as well.{nl}I'll hand you the detectors; you may install them at the Nobreer Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001370	Around three detectors should be enough to cover the intersection.{nl}After some time you should be able to see a reaction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001371	This is surest way to know, but there's no telling how long it could take.{nl}It could be days before there's any visible reaction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001372	Did you install the detectors?{nl}Now we simply need to wait for a reaction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001373	While we wait for the detectors to react, it would be best to carry on with other research.{nl}As I said, there's no telling when it will happen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001374	I say we should collect some samples from the forest plants.{nl}I believe there are some sample collecting tools among the things we left at the Lower Shipping Station.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001375	Cicas was too ill to get them organized.{nl}Please find the sample collecting tools and gather a few plant samples.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001376	After you find the tools, head to the Nobreer Falls and collect the samples.{nl}We will need samples of plants like herbs and roots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001377	If we're unable to find anything from the plants, we'll have to investigate the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001378	Did you bring the plant samples?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001379	Let's have a look then...{nl}There doesn't seem to be anything worthy of note here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001380	I'm afraid we're going to need some samples from the monsters.{nl}That is, if you will help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001381	Collecting monster samples requires a specific chemical.{nl}I believe Cicas had it, but due to his condition he had to leave it at the site we were investigating.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001382	If you go to Big Tree Footbridge, you'll find the special solution Cicas was using, along with some sample containers.{nl}I can't be sure where exactly he left them, however.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001383	After you find the solution and the containers, go to the Upper Shipping Station.{nl}Spray the solution over a few monsters there, then defeat them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001384	If a monster dies, its cells will break down, meaning the data will be inaccurate.{nl}The solution is needed to stop the cells from breaking down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001385	Let us hope the pandemic detectors react meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001386	Oh, these are very well preserved.{nl}Let's have a look...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001387	Hmm... There's certainly a type of energy here...{nl}But I'm afraid it's not enough to be sure...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001388	I can't tell if there's a connection with the Nobreer Epidemic.{nl}I need to go back and investigate it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001389	For now I suppose we can check the detectors for a reaction.{nl}Would you bring back the epidemic detectors installed at the Nobreer Intersection?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001390	I sure hope there's been a reaction...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001391	If the detectors haven't reacted, I'll be going home empty-handed.{nl}I'm worried for the patients of the disease...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001392	What? {nl}You saw something surrounded by an ominous energy head towards the Evac Route?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001393	I can feel a very strong energy from the detectors your brought back, too.{nl}It does feel similar to the energy of the disease... Although slightly different.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001394	It's certainly very strong and evil.{nl}Whatever you saw at the Nobreer Intersection could very well be the source of the epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001395	Come to think of it, I have heard talks of a Demonic Plague before.{nl}A dark demon that brings misery and despair unto humans.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001396	If what you saw was this demon... It could mean grave danger.{nl}We ought to be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001397	Remember to be careful.{nl}If it really is the Demonic Plague, it will be very dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001398	In any case, we may just get some clues about the cure from this demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001399	Did you really defeat the Demonic Plague?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001400	And you brought its core.{nl}I'm certain this is the source of the epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001401	If I bring this back to the Plague Doctor Master, he'll be able to produce a cure.{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001402	The person who's here to replace us has just arrived.{nl}Cicas isn't feeling very well either, so we should be on our way now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001403	Your precious help will always be remembered.{nl}After all, you are the one who saved all those suffering from the epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001404	There's a disease spreading around here.{nl}You should leave while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001405	I must think of those suffering from the Nobreer Epidemic and find a clue.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001406	Kupole Lenja
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001407	I am a Kupole at the service of Goddess Laima.{nl}I'm waiting for the right time here under Her orders.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001408	The treaty that goddesses and demons signed many, many eras ago is more than a simple agreement.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001409	One of my tasks is soon to be completed, it seems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001410	I do regret not paying closer attention to Laima's words, but we mustn't stop.{nl}The world is not quite over yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001411	I'm certain there will be other many actions to take, I believe Her words.{nl}Surely She still has hope.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001412	Welcome.{nl}I was waiting for you, Savior.{nl}My name is Kupole Lenja, I serve Goddess Laima.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001413	{nl}A time longer than 1000 years ago, Goddess Laima foresaw that you would arrive.{nl}She said there would be something here that must be passed unto you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001414	{nl}The truth of a distant era... A story of goddesses and demons.{nl}For a long, long time, I have waited here for you to arrive and face this truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001415	{nl}Savior, follow Her words. Retrieve the ancient treaty here kept and confirm this truth.{nl}For the world, for you, and for those foolish enough to have doubted Her words four years in the past...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001416	Goddess Laima did not tell me how to retrieve the treaty.{nl}She must have not wanted anyone but the Savior to access it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001417	{nl}She wrote the instructions to obtaining the treaty on a book called the Prophecy Tome.{nl}She made sure only the Savior would be allowed to acquire the Tome.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001418	{nl}To receive the Prophecy Tome, you must prove that you are the Savior.{nl}You may attest your status to the three stone pagodas of Pranasyste Way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001419	{nl}Prove to them that you are the Savior and the Prophecy Tome will appear to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001420	Everything must be done by the Savior, and the Savior alone.{nl}My task is merely to deliver to you the instructions and wait.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001421	Did you find the Prophecy Tome?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001422	The Tome was made by the power of Goddess Laima.{nl}Therefore, it can only be seen through the power of fate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001423	Her power is imbued in the Orb of Fate located in Rechimas Way.{nl}You must first receive the power of the Orb in order to read the Prophecy Tome.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001424	All I can do from here is wait for you to acquire the treaty and return.{nl}Everything you need to know will be written in the Prophecy Tome. I will be waiting at the Yudejan Altar.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001425	The demons have started to wander around Yudejan Forest.{nl}They covet the treaty that's hidden here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001426	{nl}They must not want the Savior to obtain it.{nl}Goddess Laima did make provisions for this moment, but still...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001427	{nl}If you cross paths with a demon, eliminating it would be the wisest thing to do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001428	My role is to merely relay unto you the words of Goddess Laima and look over the developments.{nl}All else is dependent on you alone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001429	I can only tell you to beware of the demons that covet the treaty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001430	You have obtained the treaties and the slate.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001431	Now you must read the contents of the treaty.{nl}You can do so at the Yudejan Altar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001432	Place the treaty slate in the Yudejan Altar, then set the goddess treaty and the demon treaty.{nl}The contents of the treaty should then be revealed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001433	I know neither its contents nor what they will mean to you.{nl}But if it was Laima's will to pass onto you this message through Her prophecy, surely they are important.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001434	The treaty was signed a thousand... No, more than a thousand years ago, by both demons and goddesses.{nl}Perhaps you already knew this, or perhaps you're surprised to hear it for the first time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001435	All I'm certain of is that you must know the contents of the treaty.{nl}That is what Goddess Laima prepared for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001436	I wonder if things would have been different had we listened to Laima.{nl}It's too late for that, I suppose.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001437	Did you read the treaty?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001438	I know not what meaning the treaty will have to you.{nl}I was simply told that it was meant for the eyes of the Savior.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001439	The future depends on you now.{nl}Every choice you make shall be a step towards the salvation of our world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001440	May your path be blessed, Savior...

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001640	Goddess Medeina must be talking about the butterflies that come to the flower as the preachers of love.{nl}But "Half of my heart" and "stone"?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001641	This meaning isn't clear.{nl}Is it really talking about a stone? "Half of my heart" must be about the Goddess's heart...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001642	Is the stone really just a stone with no other meaning?{nl}If that's true, is the Goddess' heart written on stone?

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001647	We need to collect the different colored apples from the trees and place them on the matching pillars.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001648	It'll be fine if we just place the colored apple on the matching pillar.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001667	{nl}Not too long after my friend left to search for parts, Hauberk's seal broke.{nl}He is currently gathering his scouts and recovering his strength.{nl}Before Hauberk regains his full power I was planning to restore the temple device that prevents the demons from invading Narvas Temple.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001668	That is why, despite the risk, I am working to restore the defensive system.{nl}But the damage to the system is so great that I do not have time to fix them all.{nl}My plan is to alter the ones that were not badly damaged.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001669	The defensive systems in Izoliacjia Plateau received the least amount of damage.{nl}I was planning to fix and alter the system, but there is not enough time to go about it alone.{nl}Would you be able to help?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001670	It is not an easy decision.But it cannot be helped.{nl}I feel like I must ask something difficult of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001671	I would be grateful if you helped.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001672	Even if we alter the defensive system here it does not have enough energy to protect the temple.{nl}But, we can use Demon Essence as a source of energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001673	Please collect the Demon Essence.{nl}While you do that, I will alter the system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001674	While you are collecting the Demon Essence, I will alter the defensive system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001675	Is that Demon Essence? Please give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001676	I have completed altering the system.{nl}It is time to move on to the defensive system in Ispejimas Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001677	We need at least 4 defensive systems to protect Narvas Temple.{nl}But, and this is including what we already altered, there are only 3 system that we can alter and use.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001678	Therefore, we must alter the detector systems here to defensive ones.{nl}{nl}But Agailla Flurry, to ensure the system ran correctly, also installed auxiliary detector systems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001679	To change the detectors, the detector and its auxiliary systems must be shut down.{nl}Yet, there are numerous systems. If even one turns back on, the remaining ones will also turn on. Making the task difficult.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001680	As I will shut down energy to the detector systems, I ask that you, Traveler, turn off all the auxiliary systems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001681	I will shut down energy to the detector systems, so I ask that you, Traveler, turn off energy to the auxiliary systems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001682	It is completed. We must now alter the defensive systems in Kapetan Pond.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001683	I need to fix some defenses before they can be remodeled, but I need some spare parts.{nl}I can get the parts from a destroyed defensive system, but it's been taken over by demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001684	Traveler, are you saying I can leave the demons to you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001685	If so, then I will quickly retrieve the parts and return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001686	Traveler, thanks to you, I have recovered the necessary parts.{nl}I will now go to repair and alter the defensive system in Kapetan Pond.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001687	I was just repairing the system when I saw some energy leaving the area around the defensive system.{nl}If all the energy disappears from the defensive system, it will not operate correctly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001688	I will alter the defensive system, so during that time please retrieve the escaping energy using the Energy Storing Globe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001689	While I alter the defensive system, please retrieve the escaping energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001690	You have returned.{nl}I will now insert the energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001691	Good.{nl}Now we must go to the defensive system located on the way to Narvas Temple.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001692	This is bad.{nl}This one is overloaded.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001693	If it continues like this, this defensive system will be completed destroyed.{nl}To cool it down, we need to remove all the energy and turn it off.{nl}If we do not, we will lose the whole system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001694	I have a request for you.{nl}When I remove the energy it will escape out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001695	At this time, please collect the energy into the Energy Storing Globe.{nl}Then use that energy to reactivate the defensive system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001696	I will now turn off the system.{nl}Please wait until I have altered it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001697	Monk Aistis is currently altering the defensive system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001698	Defensive system alterations are complete.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001699	To reactive the defensive system we will need to slowly increase the output.{nl}And to increase the output, we will need a lot of energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001700	As I increase the output, I will need you to continually insert all the energy you previously collected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001701	Each time the defensive system requires it, insert the energy you just collected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001702	The defensive system has activated.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001703	After checking that the defensive system is working properly, we can leave.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001704	We nearly left Narvas Temple open to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001705	The defensive system seems to be working well. We can make our way back inside.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001706	Agailla Flurry created various demon suppressing, demon weakening, and defensive systems in Narvas Temple.{nl}This was done to defend against invading demons and those trying to release Hauberk's seal. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001707	However, after Medzio Diena these systems were weakened and unable to function properly.{nl}To make matters worse, the demons came and destroyed a few of them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001708	We need to prevent other systems from being destroyed while also repairing them to stop Hauberk's return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001709	Good.{nl}Let us move on to the demon weakening systems in Atsargus Hall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001710	This is good. It seems we have prevented the demons from destroying this system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001711	This one can weaken the demon's strength.{nl}If we just alter its functions and reinforce it a bit we can use it to limit their power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001712	It will be okay.{nl}The demons will have no idea that their strength has been weakened.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001713	I will handle altering the system. Traveler, I need you to collect Strong Essence of Demon that we can use as energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001714	It feels like the demons would notice, but trust him and go collect the Strong Essence of Demon
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001715	Please do not worry yourself, the demons will pay us no mind.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001716	Reinforcing is complete.{nl} Now on to the systems in Atsargus Hallway.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001717	Hauberk's scouts have already broken this device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001718	Luckily, since the core of the device has not taken too much damage, I will be able to fix and alter it.{nl}However, would you be willing to help me with one part?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001719	This system, in order to locate unholy beings, runs only on clean essence.{nl}This was to prevent not only demons from coming into the temple but heretics as well. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001720	However, since the area is now overrun with demons, it will be more effective if I alter the system to focus simply on them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001721	For it to properly track demons, we will need to mix Demon's Blood and Essence together and insert it into the device.{nl}Please collect some tainted essence mixed with Demon's Blood.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001722	I do understand the unpleasantness of this task.{nl}But this is all to prevent Hauberk's return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001723	It will be fine if you just return with Essence mixed with Demon's Blood. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001724	Please put in the Essence you collected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001725	Wait a minute. Hauberk is over there.{nl}If you run in hastily, he will capture you and do the same thing he did to the others.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001726	There are too many demons.{nl}It would be better if we first go to Ziureti Hall and check on the system there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001727	We do not have time to waste.{nl}We should go now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001728	It is extremely dangerous.{nl}They have already passed on.{nl}We must retreat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001729	Do you now understand how dangerous this is?{nl}Hauberk could have easily have caught us as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001730	Sigh...{nl}Luckily, you successfully interrupted whatever Hauberk was doing. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001731	However, if you were caught, I too would be in danger. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001732	Let us not argue and focus on examining the system that is on the way to Ziureti Hall. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001733	Unidentified Facility
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001734	Speak with you...I am Agailla Flurry...apparition...

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001743	Agailla Flurry's Spirit
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001744	I wasn't able to convey myself fully, however you still knew to unlock the system, bring the Apparition Generator, and fix the device. I'm impressed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001745	You are talking with me, Agailla Flurry's Apparition, also known as the manager of Narvas Temple. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001746	I left most of the tasks to the monks, but since the three Hauberks woke up and you have arrived, I've decided to intervene.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001747	Monk Aistis' fear of dying at the hands of Ambition Hauberk left his mind weak.{nl}This made it easier for Deception Hauberk to hypnotize Aistis and gain the upper hand.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001748	Deception Hauberk did not anticipate your arrival.{nl}However, after you met Monk Aistis in Izoliacjia Plateau, Deception Hauberk decided to use you aswell.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001749	You were fooled by Deception Hauberk, but the tables have turned. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001750	In this temple is the ruthless, highly ambitions, but non-resourceful, Ambition Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001751	The constantly suspicious, concerned with preservation and always careful, is Suspicion Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001752	For thousands of years, preparing but not revealing his true intentions to the others, is Deception Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001753	To become whole they are keeping each other in check, under contact that they will not involve themselves in each others work.{nl}However, little by little Deception Hauberk is shifting the balance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001754	The problem is Deception Hauberk is taking the lead to return to his former self, Demon Lord Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001755	If this happens we will not be able to stop Demon Lord Hauberk's return.{nl}You and I will use the current imbalance to defeat Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001756	Help Monk Aistis and, to completely break the balance of power, take my staff to Deception Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001757	I awaited your return.{nl}If you hand over the magic crystal you collected, I will improve the system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001758	In Ziureti Hall, the weapon that can defy Hauberk, Agailla Flurry's Staff is protected by a device..{nl}We should there and collect the staff.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001759	Return to Monk Aistis and follow what he says.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001760	Able to defy Hauberk, Agailla Flurry's Staff contains an enormous amount power.{nl}Thus, if demons are around, the device protecting the staff will not open.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001761	When there are no demons around, you'll be able to open it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001762	You can open the device now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001763	Agailla Flurry Apparition
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001764	With that, the balance of power has been shattered.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001765	Use this imbalance of power ignite a fight amongst themselves.{nl}I will explain more in Narvas Temple Annex.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001766	Deception Hauberk has acquired Agailla Flurry's staff but to become whole he must absorb Ambition Hauberk and Suspicion Hauberk.{nl}And to explain to the other two Hauberks, without any misunderstand, the events that have occurred here will be difficult. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001767	However, Deception Hauberk has not concerned himself with how he will go about absorbing the remaining two.{nl}This we will take advantage of.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001768	We will make it obvious to the other two Hauberks that Deception Hauberk is planning an attack.{nl}Plant the idea that Deception Hauberk is weakening them in order to easily absorb them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001769	Now, if you say that the system in Deception Hauberk's Sealed Hall has been altered, Monk Aistis will say otherwise.{nl}His response will be obvious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001770	This is because he does not know what goes on here.{nl}Do not worry about the systems. Instead go to Deception Hauberk and do as I have said.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001771	Do not concern yourself with the connection between this and the systems.{nl}If you trust me and follow what I say, we will stop Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001772	I will consider what needs to be done and tell you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001773	If you wish to fix this system, I will need parts from Flurry's device.{nl}These parts are small making them hard to find.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001774	Please use this Absorbing Stone.{nl}When you use it it will  attract the small parts and pull them towards you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001775	Please use the Absorbing Stone and bring Flurry's Device Parts to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001776	Agailla Flurry Apparition
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001777	Just as I wanted, you have conveyed the message to Deception Hauberk.{nl}You did well in such a dangerous situation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001778	Now, we must make Suspicion Hauberk and Ambition Hauberk aware of Deception Hauberk's actions.{nl}Once they are aware, they will begin to fight.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001779	We will start by informing Suspicion Hauberk.{nl}However, seeing as he is a filled with suspicion, if we do not prepare correctly, he will not fall into our trap. Rather he will simply become more suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001780	You must ransform into the trusted King Hammer and inform him of Deception Hauberk's plan.{nl}Suspicion Hauberk believes himself to be the weakest of the Hauberks. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001781	Therefore, he will concern himself with how to become whole.{nl}At that point, you most reveal the Contract Token you are carrying.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001782	He and the other Hauberks have searched madly for this item that, when he sees it, it will increase his trust in you.{nl}And, tell Hauberk that the Token needs to be changed before use or it will inflict great harm.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001783	If Suspicion Hauberk is of sound mind, he will say to do this right away.{nl}Then leave Suspicion Hauberk's Sealed Hall and come to Ketinimas Hall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001784	Agailla Flurry left preparations in case Hauberk was awakened and turned his attacks on the monks.{nl}It's the device right next to me. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001785	So that the monks could safety evacuate, this device creates scrolls that change the appearance of the user into a monster. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001786	To create a King Hammer transformation scroll you will need a body essence.{nl}If you collect the Flesh of Black Hohen Olben, you can use that in the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001787	First go and collect the Flesh of Black Hohen Olben.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001788	You have done well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001789	Now we need King Hammer's Blood.{nl}In time, the King Hammers searching for the Contract Token will be passing this way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001790	Defeat them and insert the King Hammer's Blood into the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001791	The transformation scroll is complete.{nl}Now, use this scroll to transform into King Hammer and approach Suspicion Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001792	You made that look too easy. Well done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001793	Now, changing the power within the Contract Token is not easy.{nl}While you were away, I changed the function of the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001794	It took time, but it turned out well.{nl}However, the device still does not have the energy it needs to change the power within the Contract Token.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001795	Replacing the energy with condensed magic will be suitable.{nl}Yes, strengthening it with condensed magic will do the trick.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001796	To gain strength, each of Hauberk's Drooper Scouts are in possession of one.{nl}If you defeat them you'll be able to obtain the condensed magic. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001797	Gather it and insert it into the device.{nl}When you have inserted enough, insert the Contract Token and I will transform its power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001798	You think it's easy changing the Token's power?{nl}Well, in case it was necessary, Agailla Flurry did prepare changeable functions for the devices.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001799	I have changed the power within the Contract Token.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001800	Please inform Suspicion Hauberk of the Contract Token's change.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001801	Suspicion Hauberk has been taken in by your wonderful acting.{nl}We are a little pressed for time, so I will relay the next stage of the plan at Ambition Hauberk's Sealed Hall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001802	You have arrived.{nl}Now we must reel in Ambition Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001803	Ambition Hauberk's Elite Banshee King has died by your hand, correct?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001804	When you defeated the Banshee King, the tortured monks we released.{nl}Due to that, reeling Ambition Hauberk in will not be difficult. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001805	Instead, it will be easier.{nl}You'll be able to brainwash the Black Harugal residing under Ambition Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001806	There is one device created by the monks.{nl}It was created by the High Monk in order for them to not forget the important matters at hand. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001807	That device is right here.{nl}If you record the matter into the device it prints it on the Registry Orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001808	For a short period of time, one will not forget the demands contained in the Orb.{nl}To make it simple, you can think of it as a type of suggestive brainwashing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001809	To create this Registry Orb we only need to record two sentences into the device. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001810	First 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001811	Deception Hauberk secretly discarded the monk need to transform the spirits. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001812	{nl}Second 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001813	To attack Ambition Hauberk, the Monastery's systems were altered.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001814	Maybe there will not be enough words to choose from.{nl}Combine what you can and I will perfect the sentences.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001815	Rememebr, you only need to record two sentences into the Registry Device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001816	Selecting the words must have been difficult, yet you did well and created the perfect Registry Orb. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001817	Among the Black Harugal are Ambition Hauberk's elite servants. They are marked with a special essence.{nl}This essence is difficult for the human eye to spot.{nl}However, there is a way around this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001818	Collect the essence of the Black Harugal and we can use it to create an orb that will be able to determine which of the Harugal are Ambition Hauberk's elite servants.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001819	Good.{nl}I will now make an orb that will be able to differentiate Ambition Hauberk's elite servants from amongst the Black Harugal
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001820	Just insert the Black Harugal's essence into the device.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001885	{nl}I assume you have already heard from Neringa what it that we do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001886	{nl}I asked Neringa as well.{nl}What can a human do for us here?

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001967	In fact, Goddess Vaivora has more conviction than Neringa thought.{nl}Neringa will need to execute this plan more precisely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001968	Kupole Litae and Danute are in charge of this area.{nl}Kupole Danute will still be unsure about you.{nl}But defeat the demons and she will come you way.{nl}Please listen to her request.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001969	{nl}For Neringa's role, Neringa will leave first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001970	Kupole Litae
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001971	I can't believe you came here, but even more so, I can't believe your skills.{nl}I've heard of your courage and sacrifice from the other Kupole.{nl}Thank you very much for coming to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001972	You've arrived.{nl}Did Kupole Litae greet you well?{nl}The Kupole are also different in their thinking and personalities.{nl}Some listen better than others.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001973	Goddess Vaivora will come to find you again.{nl}But before that, there is something you need to prepare.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001974	You and Neringa will face Giltine in Valandis Room 91.{nl}The Demon Goddess can take your life with just one finger.{nl}So please find some Nobrenal Blueprints so that Neringa may use them to protect you.{nl}With Neringa's divine energy and that item, it will be possible to hold back her power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001975	Unfortunately, Goddess Laima cannot protect you.{nl}However, Neringa will tell you how to protect yourself.{nl}Believe Neringa and follow what Neringa says.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001976	That should be enough.{nl}Neringa will tell you when it is time to use it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001977	Now go to Goddess Vaivora.{nl}There are still parts Neringa needs to prepare for the plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001978	Your help is making the final preparations much easier.{nl}Now, please help us one last time. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001979	{nl}I must leave this place to examine Giltine's actions more closely.{nl}Kupole Danute is coming so please lend a hand.{nl}I hope that you help her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001980	Kupole Danute
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001981	As Vaivora predicted, the demons are gathering her to make it easier for Giltine to enter.{nl}There is no time to waste so I must ask you for two items.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001982	The first is Dimensional Essence.{nl}That will be easy to find around here.{nl}The last one will be a problem...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001983	Defeat the demons and gather their magic source.{nl}After collecting both, come back here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001984	Now with this you can defend the protection crystals.{nl}I will combine this and make you a tool.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001985	The protection crystals are under attack!{nl}Since all of the library's energy is directed towards the trap,{nl}there is only one protection crystal guarding this area.{nl}If the protection crystals are not working,{nl}Giltine will still be able to escape even if we seal her within our trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001986	Take this tool and until the protection crystals are recharged, fend off the demons!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001987	Thank you!{nl}And Neringa has returned as well.{nl}I will go and help with Vaivora's seal.{nl}I'm grateful for your help!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001988	Vaivora has finished her seal for Giltine.{nl}Unfortunately, Giltine will not appear this time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001989	Please remain calm and do as Vaivora instructed.{nl}Come back to Neringa when the work there is done.{nl}Neringa is preparing for the next plan. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001990	That is a record.{nl}Neringa will give it back to Vaivora.{nl}Right now you must deal with the embarrased Goddess of Knowledge. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001991	Goddess Vaivora knows much more than you or Neringa, expect for the future.{nl}Therefore it is impossible to convince Vaivora
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001992	Vaivora will now make an extreme choice.{nl}Give up the revelation and remove Giltine from this world.{nl}She still thinks that is correct.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001993	In the meantime, let's move to Valandis Room 3.{nl}There you and Neringa will listen to the Goddess plans and follow.{nl}Neringa will go first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001994	Goddess Vaivora has instructed you to collect all the magical energy that can be used on the Sealing Altar.{nl}There are devices around the library that you can collect the magic from.{nl}Please activate them.{nl}The activated magic devices will go where they are needed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001995	There was a human who came here without an invitation.{nl}But you are the first to be formally invited.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001996	That looks like enough.{nl}Also, Neringa is looking for you.{nl}It would be good if you go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001997	{nl}I will finish the rest of the work here.{nl} I will be off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001998	I'm surprised by your work.{nl}Human potential seems to know no bounds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001999	To play a part in continuing human history, I will tell you something.{nl}Several hundred years ago, Demon Goddess Giltine had already invaded this place.{nl}She was looking for a record of herself.{nl}But at the time she could not obtain it.{nl}So she comes again today.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002000	I do not know where she will use it.{nl}But she is coming to this place soon to get her hands on that record.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002001	We have taken advantage of her greed by preparing a trap.{nl}As she becomes overcome with joy for finally getting her hands on the record, she will disappear from this world.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002002	If she disappears from this world, every problem will be solved.{nl}All of the Goddesses will return to their rightful places and you too may go home. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002003	For this I need your help.{nl}My Kupole are in the final stages of perfecting the trap.{nl}Please help them.{nl}I also have last minute preparations. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002004	Once again, thank you for your courage and you sacrifice.{nl}For the sake of the world, please endure just a little bt longer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002005	Please collect them quickly!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002006	How's the protection crystal?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002007	Danute is still unfocused.{nl}This may be a handful for a human such as yourself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002008	But if you have nothing else to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002009	Vaivora wants to destroy part of the Fantasy Library in order to prevent others from entering.{nl}But it will not go according to the Goddess' wish.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002010	It's quite unfortunate.{nl}To ensure that the prediction comes true, you must artfully disrupt the Goddess's plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002011	And the Goddess must not know that you and Neringa are the ones to blame.{nl}So follow the Goddess's plans for awhile.{nl}When it is time to execute our own plan, Neringa will call you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002012	To sacrifice a part of the district to capture Giltine.{nl}Vaivora's plan seems reckless.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002013	Vaivora will ask you to activate the sealing device set up in Valandis Room 3.{nl}Go about the task.{nl}Neringa will also do as such.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002014	{nl}Go to Vaivora.{nl}Neringa will call you when it is time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002015	Time is running out and there are not many Kupoles remaining that I can call...{nl}You will be able to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002016	{nl}Here Skywa is helping me to operate the Bluenode Collapsing Device.{nl}But the energy from this device is calling demons to it.{nl}Please go there and protect the device for me.{nl}If we lose even one, Giltine will slip away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002017	It hurts me as well to make such a decision.{nl}And I will bear this crime for eternity. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002018	{nl}But to save the world from Giltine's grip...{nl}It's an expensive sacrifice that must be done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002019	Amazing!{nl}The activated collapsing device will conceal its magic, and will not face attack again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002020	{nl}Now Skywa will activate the collapsing device remotely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002021	Next we need to activate the second collapsing device.{nl}However, it does not have enough energy to run.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002022	Gather the Monumental Magic Source around the area of the second collapsing device.{nl}After that, listen to Neringa about what to do next.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002023	{nl}I will return after surveilling Valandis Room 91.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002024	I will not be gone long.{nl}However, while I am away please consult Neringa if you need help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002025	Our goal is to cause the Balanorth Collapsing Device to overload.{nl}Until then we will continue to follow Vaivora's plan, so as to not alert suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002026	Skywa is walking around and managing the collapsing devices.{nl}Operating them is simple enough. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002027	Insert the Monumental Magic Source that you have in your possession into the device.{nl}As the device re-energizes, protect it until it can conceal its magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002028	Right now the Goddess is checking on Demon Goddess Giltine's rampage in Valandis Room 91.{nl}As pressing as the matter is, the Goddess will not use the Fantasy Library as a burial ground for Giltine.{nl}Please follow the plan thoughtfully and reliably.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002029	You have successfully energized the device.{nl}It's good to know the plan is right on schedule.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002030	{nl}Giltine is currently in Valandis Room 91 searching frankly for the revelation.{nl}Let us finally finish the task before us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002031	Now, there are only a few devices left to run.{nl}But is there enough time to leave everything to Skywa...{nl}And it would be difficult to protect.{nl}Would you be willing to help Skywa?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002032	{nl}Make your way to Ballandans collapsing device.{nl}Skywa will be waiting for you there. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002033	Kupole Skywa
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002034	The human helping Vaivora is you?{nl}This is my first time seeing one, but you seem particularly strong.{nl}I have a job for you..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002035	Skywa cannot complete this work alone.{nl}Make sure to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002036	Not too long ago, I set the Ballandans Collapsing Device.{nl}I was going to activate another device here as well, but the demons swarmed me.{nl}If I waste my time on them, I won't be able to finish the work Vaivora gave me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002037	{nl}How about clearing out those demons from around the Ballandans collapsing device?{nl}You just need to protect it until the device is set and conceals itself..{nl}While you deal with this, I'll be able to go and finish my other remaining tasks. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002038	Thank you so much!{nl}Humans are so kind, no?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002039	{nl}Alright, I'm going to go finish my other preparations.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002040	Your help is appreciated.{nl}Thanks to you, Skywa was able to complete the rest of the preparations.{nl}Now only Balanorth collapsing device is left.{nl}Shall I give this remaining task to you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002041	{nl}When all is ready, just turn on the device.{nl}Oh, right Neringa was looking for you.{nl}It seems she also needs your help.{nl}I'll wait here for your successful return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002042	Everything has been prepared.{nl}And Vaivora has no reason to distrust you.{nl}You received the request to handle the Balanorth collapsing device, no?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002043	When activating that device, the demon leaders will appear and interrupt you.{nl}When the demon leaders are defeated they will release great amounts of energy.{nl}We will use that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002044	Please lure the head monsters closer to the Balanorth device and defeat them there.{nl}Their released energy will overheat the device and destroy it.{nl}Then Vaivora's mission will fail in its final step.{nl}Once you have completed this task, you and Neringa will go together to Valandis Room 91. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002045	{nl}Please do not forget.{nl}You must defeat the head monsters when they are nearest to the device. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002046	All of history is recorded in Fantasy Library.{nl}Of course, records about you are also here.{nl}This is a situation where a human is involved in both Goddess and demon history. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002047	{nl}But, sadly, it will not be recorded.{nl}Neringa has destroyed all records of your involvement.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002048	Vaivora has sensed that something has gone wrong.{nl}She believed all to be finished.{nl}But right now there is no reason to care about her. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002049	{nl}Neringa will head towards Valandis Room 91 first.{nl}I will inform Vaivora that the plan has failed.{nl}Then you must come straight to Valandis Room 91.{nl}Neringa will wait for you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002050	How did it turn out like this?{nl}The device isn't responding.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002051	You've failed me.{nl}Now I see the human limits.{nl}I was stupid...{nl}But it's not your fault.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002052	It was my fault for giving such an important task to a human.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002053	I...{nl}The next plan is...{nl}To stop Giltine I could...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002054	Everywhere has become polluted and ruined by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}Vaivora, before she destroys everything, us included, you must take action.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002055	At this point...{nl}All we can do is collapse the Fantasy Library and trap Giltine...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002056	It's no use.{nl}There is a no way a human can complete against a Demon Goddess...{nl}However, a human chosen by Laima may be different.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002057	{nl}I wish not to put you harm's way.{nl}But I need you to buy us some time until the Kupole and I can figure out how to trap Giltine.{nl}Right now, this is our best plan...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002058	Demon Goddess Giltine is summoning her demons to Valandis Room 91.{nl}Neringa is sure she is residing there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002059	{nl}You need to stop Giltine before she gets her hands on the revelation and escapes.{nl}To do this you must destroy the dimensional doors used to summon the demons.{nl}Then, you and Neringa will need to prepare a way to keep you safe from Giltine.{nl}But first, destroy the doors.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002060	This incident is coming to and end just as the Goddess predicted.{nl}And your role has become more important.{nl}Neringa will make the necessary preparations and, during this time,{nl}destroy as many Dimensional Doors as possible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002061	We have almost reached where Demon Goddess Giltine is residing.{nl}Nearby is the revelation Goddess Laima prepared for Giltine.{nl}Giltine has already burned her way through the library to reach that one revelation.{nl}And Goddess Laima has said that you also must be there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002062	{nl}Stay near Neringa.{nl}Neringa will keep you safe.{nl}But you must also keep Neringa safe from the demon minions.{nl}Now let us follow Giltine. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002063	{nl}Now we only need to follow Giltine.{nl}Stay close. If you get too far away from Neringa, you will be struck by Giltine's power. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002064	The time has come to end this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002065	Goddess Laima spoke of a day where Giltine's black wings will be broken.{nl}But this is not that day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002066	{nl}From here forward, you will face Giltine alone.{nl}Neringa did not appear in the final scene of Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}Under the black wing's shadow is the future.{nl}Suppress your fear and continue forward.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002067	Fate, itself, will protect you.{nl}Go forth.{nl}You are the Revelator. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002068	You have successfully fulfilled Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}Then, Neringa's role here is done.{nl}But the journey for you has not come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002069	Now that this is over, Goddess Laima wishes to guide you to Astral Tower.{nl}At the tower will be a revelation for you to find.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002070	At Astral Tower there will be new hardships and revelations waiting for you.{nl}However, all of this follows from Goddess Laima. You will be safe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002071	Before leaving, report to Vaivora that the revelation was not retrieved.{nl}And that Neringa has also left.{nl}She will not ask you why.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002072	I see.. this is how things turned out..{nl}I appreciate your courage and sacrifice.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002073	This is the second time I have missed Giltine is my own library.{nl}It seems Laima and my sisters will berate me for this...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002074	I knew that Neringa would leave eventually.{nl}She was always around but her presence was never imposing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002075	If we ever meet again, there is much I want to ask.{nl}But it will have to wait until the world is freed from Giltine's grasp.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002076	Once again thank you for your sacrifice.{nl}And my apologies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002077	Please take this with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002078	This power was something given to me by Laima through Neringa.{nl}And it was Neringa who told me to pass this on to you, once everything was finished.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002079	Resistor Skirgaila
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002080	I'm sorry to suddenly stop you, but could you lend me a hand.{nl}We, as part of the resistance, are doing recon in this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002081	But as were going about this task, the Beholder came and kidnapped our Lieutenant.{nl}There is no one else who can help.Please, please rescue our Lieutenant..
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002082	Sorry, I'm really sorry.If we were more focused, this never would have happened..{nl}To push this request on you so suddenly..but a person's life hangs in the balance. Please, I beg you. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002083	Our relationship is in the gutter, but I'm willing to make a deal with you here.{nl}And of course, our intentions are none of your concern.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002084	But you want to save the so-called Lieutenant, and I want to make a simple deal with you that involves Demon Lord Solcomm.{nl}Think before answering. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002085	Alright, here it is. Nearby, Solcomm has installed a Crystal Stone to supply himself with magic power.{nl}Your task is to use this Orb to absorb the magic from the stone and return it to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002086	Oh, and I was told that the Crystal Stone is protected by something or another.{nl}You can just investigate that by yourself. You got this, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002087	Alright, good.The Crystal Stone we need to work on is the one in Prieblanda Rest Place.{nl}There are pillars near the stone, so maybe that's the defense systems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002088	If you activate them in order, the defense field rotating around the crystal will disappear. That will be your cue to absorb the energy.{nl}If you mess up, it won't be a huge problem. But it'll be incredibly annoying.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002089	You still haven't absorbed the Crystal Stone's energy, yet you show no fear. Why is that?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002090	I'll say it again. Activate each of the pillars in Prieblanda Rest Place in order and when the defense field disappears,{nl}absorb the energy from the Crystal Stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002091	There will come a time where you will need my help. Alright, let's move on.{nl}Did you really think doing one task would be enough? Of course not.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002092	The Crystal Stone I knew the most about was the one in Prieblanda. I only know the location of the others.{nl}The next one is at Lemtis Lot. I'll leave investigating the defense systems and absorbing the magic to you. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002093	Why do I want to get rid of Solcomm?{nl}Do you really think that I, the bearer of concepts that existed before humans, will share them with someone such as yourself?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002094	Looks like you succeeded again. Yet, I'm getting a suspicious vibe.{nl}Hm, well, right now the Crystal Stones are most important.{nl}Let's move on. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002095	The next Crystal Stone is in Zibukas Crossroad.{nl}Go ahead first to investigate and I'll follow soon after. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002096	You would think that guy would have appeared by now...Of course, the intelligence was correct.{nl}Don't question things you haven't heard. Now stop staring and let's go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002097	You sense a strange energy around the Crystal?{nl}It seems that Crystal Stone is protected by a different type of magic. You'll just have to neutralize its effects.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002098	I gave you a magic nullifying tool, no? The time has come for you to use it.{nl}Right now it has no power, but defeat a few of Solcomm's minions and monsters and fill it up with their spirits. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002099	Fill the tool magic by defeating the monsters and Solcomm's minions in the area.{nl}When it's fully charged, go and remove the magic around the Crystal Stone. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002100	And like that, the Stone in this area has been handled...But still...{nl}There should have been some sort of appearance when that human broke the first Crystal Stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002101	Are you acting more cautious than before, or are you scared?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002102	The human I brought along ended up breaking the Crystal Stone that was here.{nl}Trying to make my life difficult, I see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002103	But despite all this, Solcomm has yet to appear.{nl}And now that I think about it, outside Zibukas Crossroad hasn't been checked. I'll have to inspect there as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002104	If Solcomm isn't found, then this whole process has been meaningless.{nl}This doesn't bode well for you either. Go check the location I mentioned.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002105	Since there was a trap in place, there was no use. That's how he kept his Demon Lord status. Pretty arrogant, no?{nl}One can understand Pbeta's interest. Anyway, since there was a trap there, that means he's in this area. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002106	Well, even if it's not necessarily a trap, I think Solcomm is hiding in this area looking for his chance.{nl}Don't be a chicken. Look carefully and smoke him out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002107	It's disappointing that Solcomm escaped this time, but he won't be free of me so easily.{nl}There are very few places where he can run off too, so it's only a matter of time. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002108	I'm completely grateful that you completed my request, despite its unreasonableness.{nl}And now I know it's shameless to ask you for another, but I do have a favor to ask.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002109	Our task here is to do recon on the area but certain circumstances have made it difficult.{nl}I trust your strength and I ask for your help. With it, we can safely complete our work here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002110	Really thank you! The first task is to burn the demon's supply chests.{nl}Before you arrived, I had investigated the area and found a few of them here and there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002111	The supplies have yet to be arranged.{nl}We cannot miss this opportunity to cause some confusion. I'll provide the materials needed to start a fire, so please help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002112	What's happening here... It was quite a lucky chance to come here and see Solcomm's movements.{nl}And the Crystal Stone to be broken... the Lieutenant should have been more careful...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002113	Thank you. The demons will also face some confusion over their disappearing supplies.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002114	Seeing as how strong you are, I hope that you can help with another task.{nl}Zibukas Crossroad is always overrun with demons that it makes recon incredibly difficult.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002115	What I'm saying is: our information is a bit outdated. Please take this Parchment and{nl}record the overall layout of the area in that direction. Would this be possible?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002116	For a long time we have been unable to investigate Zibukas Crossroad due to the number of demons.{nl}The resistance would greatly benefit from your help in this matter. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002117	Thanks to you we can finally update our information.{nl}This will surely help the resistance's future plans. Thank you very much. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002118	You mentioned some wagons in the record you wrote. The demons must be using them to move their supplies.{nl}I'll give you the tools necessary to burn down those wagons. Then, the demons will also face some hardships.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002119	If it wasn't for you, we would have missed these small details.{nl}The information you have recorded for us, will help the resistance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002120	Well done! For the time being, the supply line to this direction has been cut.{nl}You did us a great favor. Really, thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002121	Thanks to you, our task has become a bit easier but those demons still weigh on my mind...{nl}To help our recon work run more smoothly, could you please get rid of the demons in the area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002122	I am forever indebted to you. And I'm sure the Goddess will also hear of the work you have done for us
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002123	Just amazing! Work will go on a bit more smoothly now.{nl}Of course, completely eliminating the demons will be difficult, but you are free to try.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002124	Resistor Abraomas
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002125	If it's okay with you, I have a small request. Actually a new recruit who went looking for the Lieutenant went missing.{nl}I went searching for him myself but its a bit hard for me to keep moving.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002126	Any kind of information would be good..{nl}In this vicinity, if you find a clue about the new recruit will you please inform me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002127	Please... let him be safe. I worry so much. He is full of guts but has so much to learn...Hah.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002128	T-This...belonged to out new recruit! Then this means something did happen.{nl} Ohhh...if only he was more careful...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002129	If... he's really gone... M-maybe across there...? But that would be dangerous!{nl}The number of demons there... I'm sorry but could you please go across there and look for him?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002130	Thank you. I want to go myself but... as you can see, Officer Skirgaila said it is dangerous...{nl}Please go in my stead...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002131	Any kind of trace of him would be good. No matter what you come across, please tell me.{nl}This person is very important to me...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002132	That... belonged to him. That was the extra dragger he carried with him.{nl}Ohh, after gathering all these clues, is it still okay to believe he is still alive?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002133	The last place is Lanko 22 Waters.. that's the demon's post. Which makes me more worried.{nl}Could you please check this final location? Ah, his name 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002134	Leonardas
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002135	Leonardas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002136	Although we are not blood relatives, this recruit is like a brother to me.{nl}He always looked up to me and followed me into the army...If he disappears I...Ohhh...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002137	Resistor Leonardas
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002138	Wh-Who are you? You? Abraomas asked you to come find me? Ha, haha...thank you.{nl}I really though...I would die...really...I've caused so much trouble...Ah, again, thank you for coming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002139	I have something to do so, you, go to Lanko 22 Waters. Find Solcomm and kill him.{nl}If you try to pull anything funny, just remember that I have the person you're looking for. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002140	...You've arrived. You've received a request from the Beholder to kill me, no?{nl}Before you do, I have a question. What did the Beholder say about me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002141	So that's what he thinks... and you are forced to work with him. I understand everything now.{nl}I'll tell you this. The energy that the Beholder has asked you to gather is not mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002142	The true purpose of the Crystal Stones is to record information about the area. In other words, what you collected was information.{nl}Now image if this fell into the Beholder's hands..Where will he use it, I wonder.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002143	You understand quickly. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002144	Killing me
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002145	was the request, but there was none for destroying the Crystal Stone.{nl}That's the key. I would recommend interrupting his little plan by destroying them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002146	I wouldn't say anything bad to a person who was taken advantage of. Now, tell me your thoughts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002147	Your task is to destroy the two Crystal Stones here and the remaining ones in Lanko 26 Waters.{nl}The ones here and the ones there are connected so using the self-destruction device will work fine. It won't be dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002148	Start with the ones over here. Negilus Inner Court is the closest so check that Crystal Stone first.{nl}The security devices are running, so destroy them all. If you do, the Crystal Stone will follow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002149	Not only that one, but other Crystal Stones are protected in various ways.{nl}This is protect the records from others. What? This information isn't exclusive. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002150	Well... you can also see it from your view.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002151	Hm... fascinating. Next, the Crystal Stone in the garden.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002152	The Stone in the garden is protected by magic, just like the ones you saw in the crossroads in Lanko 26 Waters.{nl}The easiest way to destroy it is to use a bomb that can penetrate and remove magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002153	You will have to make this bomb yourself. Here is the recipe and the materials.{nl} The rest are roots that you will have to gather from Lily Velly and Jelly Velly. Once the bomb is made, use it to destroy the Crystal Stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002154	Until now the Beholder has only sent his minions and has not appeared himself.{nl}What is he planning...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002155	Very good. Now to address the Crystal Stone in Lanko 26 Waters.{nl}We can overlook what type of plan he is devising, but we cannot allow the Beholder to have his way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002156	The self-destruction device is hidden between the rocks in Dregnas Lot. Find it and activate it.{nl}But it will take some time, so I recommend keeping a lookout.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002157	Based on what you told me, I've realized that changing the Beholder's mind won't be possible.{nl}Instead, I'm going to thwart his plans. This is the conclusion I've come to.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002158	Now all of the Crystal Stone's are gone. The Beholder must be pulling hairs since his plan had been interrupted.{nl}And he will be on his way. Before all is revealed, I have another request for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002159	This request may be difficult for you to accept.{nl}But if you think of your future, this could be profitable. What do you think? Here me out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002160	Although the result was different from intended, it was acceptable.{nl}I've already returned the Lieutenant you were looking for.He's possibly on his way back to the other resistance members by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002161	Well then, we'll part ways here. Stay alive, at least until we meet again.{nl}That will be my reward, no?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002162	I would like to return, but I've hurt myself here and there, making it hard for me to move.{nl}Would you mind lending me a hand?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002163	Thank you. Could you collect the materials I need?{nl}First you need to water the Lily Velly and Jelly Velly that live here with lake water and then gather their leaves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002164	Have you heard? The water from Star Struck Lake Water is fatal to demons.{nl}What I'm making now will not be as effective, but I'm trying to make it as close to the level of Star Struck Lake as I can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002165	Thank you. Now let's move on to the next stage.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002166	I'm trying to craft magical sap that has the effect of Star Struck Lake. However, we need something more than just the leaf.{nl}There are catalysts that promote magical reactions in the demons' storage nearby. Could you bring those to me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002167	I found that storage in the past while trying to hide from demons.{nl}After going inside, I found a box, and saw the catalyst inside. I wanted to make something like this with the catalyst ever since.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002168	Thank you! All that's left to do is to make the sap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002169	We're almost done! Can you craft some sap with the ingredients and the bottle I gave you?{nl}Here is the recipe for the sap. I'm sure you're much better at doing things like this than I am...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002170	I really hope this works like I hope it does. Everyone must be worried sick about me.{nl}I've even disobeyed orders to come here??I know I'll be in trouble, but I still want to go back soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002171	You're back! We'll be done after testing this sap on a demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002172	Here is a bottle of the sap we've made. Find a demon to test this on.{nl}If it works, you'll see its effects immediately. After that, please make sure to deal with the affected demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002173	How did it go? Did you have any trouble dealing with the demons?{nl}This is the first time I've actually made the sap, so I hope it worked.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002174	Thank you! I think I've mostly recovered while you were making the sap.{nl}All I have to do now is go back with the sap!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002175	Wait! I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to get back to my friends. However, I'm hurt...{nl}If you can, will you get rid of the demons around here to help me get back to my friends?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002176	There are lots of demons scattered around the way back to my friends.{nl}Would you get rid of these demons for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002177	Everyone must be worried about me... I disobeyed orders to find my lieutenant...{nl}I hope Adjutant General and everyone else is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002178	Thank you. There are still some demons left in the area, but the situation has gotten much better.{nl}If possible, come back anytime to help me a bit more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002179	This is troubling... I guess when it rains, it pours...{nl}Hey! Here! Ahh... Never mind. Sorry to bother you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002180	My heart goes to you for helping us.{nl}Without you, we would still be regretting what we've done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002181	Ah, it's you. Welcome. I've just heard that our lieutenant has returned. I truly appreciate your help!{nl}For now, we'll stay here a bit longer to assess the situation. We still need to carry on with our mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002182	I should have stopped him when I had the chance... If I have, this would not have happened...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002183	Huh? Is Leonardas still alive? The goddess must be watching over us...{nl}Thank you! And thank the goddess...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002184	Leonardas is getting ready to come back? With his injuries? Oh, goodness...{nl}We need to do something to help him. Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002185	Is there anything left to do? If you're worried about what I'm doing,{nl}don't bother. You wouldn't even understand. Just keep walking.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002186	Ughh... I need to go back... But my legs won't move the way I want... I hope everyone is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002187	I need to go back to my comrades as soon as I can, but my injuries...{nl}Will you please help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002188	Thanks to you, I feel much better. I better get going.{nl}I've come this far, so I'll remain here for a bit to record the area. Thanks for your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002189	All right. I'll be brief and to the point.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002190	Ugh... Monsters took off with our supplies.{nl}We were preoccupied with demons...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002191	We need to repair the altar...{nl}No one expected demons to come here and destroy the altar...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002192	Following Jurate's words is becoming harder and harder.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002193	The demons' attacks are growing fiercer by the day.{nl}We need to do something about this...

QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002958	If you save her, Goddess Vaivora's expectations of you will rise.{nl}Destroy the magic prison and save Kupole Ouida.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002959	She will then have a request for you.{nl}After that we will meet the Beholder.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002960	I trust and follow you in accordance with the prediction.{nl}Refrain from unnecessary actions and concentrate on your role.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002961	And you are?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002962	A human... I thought I would be saved by Vaivora...{nl}It's not what I expected but thank you for rescuing me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002963	The Beholder has installed magical prisons everywhere.{nl}The Kupole are in a state of confusion allowing the Beholder to rummage through the library.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002964	But we cannot allow this to continue.{nl}Will you allow them to roam around Vaivora's library? Open your eyes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002965	The reason they can roam here is because the protection crystals were destroyed.{nl}The remaining one is being attacked by the demons now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002966	Ride this transportation device to the crystal.{nl}Defeat them all with your power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002967	You do not need to return to Ouida.{nl}Time is short. We must go to Goddess Vaivora after facing him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002968	The Beholder must be growing aware that their plan is falling apart.{nl}Soon the Beholder will be here. Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002969	The Beholder follows Demon Goddess Giltine but shows no interest in her safety.{nl}He will leave soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002970	With Neringa, you will need to go to Valandis Room 2.{nl}When you are ready, follow. Neringa will go first and wait for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002971	The Beholder still does not know you and Neringa are here.{nl}Neringa will stay out of the way until the Beholder thinks the task is done.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002972	If Neringa is discovered here, Giltine will be alerted.{nl}Now we have to let them destroy the Fantasy Library.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002973	Why did they come here at this time?{nl}This is troublesome.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002974	Talk of you helping Vaivora's Kupoles is circulating amongst them.{nl}Goddess Vaivora will come to look for you soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002975	She will trust you and tell you her plans.{nl}But you and Neringa's plans differ from the Goddess Vaivora's.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002976	Don't forget this. Listen politely to all the Goddess has to say.{nl}Goddess is coming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002977	In fact, Goddess Vaivora has more conviction than Neringa thought.{nl} Neringa will need to execute this plan more precisely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002978	Kupole Litae and Danute are in charge of this area.{nl}Kupole Litae will still be unsure about you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002979	But defeat the demons and she will come to your way.{nl}Please listen to her request. For Neringa's role, Neringa will leave first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002980	I can't believe you came here, but even more so, I can't believe your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002981	I've heard of your courage and sacrifice from the other Kupole.{nl}Thank you very much for coming to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002982	You've arrived. Did Kupole Litae greet you well?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002983	The Kupole are also different in their thinking and personalities.{nl}Some listen better than others.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002984	{nl}Goddess Vaivora will come to find you again.{nl}But before that, there is something you need to prepare.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002985	You and Neringa will face Giltine in Valandis Room 91.{nl}The Demon God can take your life with just one finger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002986	So please find the item Nobraenal Blueprint so that Neringa may use that to protect you.{nl}With Neringa's divine energy and that item I will be able to hold back her power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002987	Unfortunately, Goddess Laima cannot protect you.{nl}However, Neringa will tell you how to protect yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002988	Believe Neringa and follow what Neringa says.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002989	That should be enough.{nl}Neringa will tell you when it is time to use it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002990	Now go to Goddess Vaivora.{nl}There are still parts Neringa needs to prepare for the plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002991	Your help is making the final preparations much easier.{nl}Now, please help us one last time. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002992	I must leave this place to examine Giltine's actions more closely.{nl}Kupole Danute is coming so please lend a hand. I hope that you help her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002993	As Vaivora predicted, the demons are gathering her to make it easier for Giltine to enter.{nl}There is no time to waste so I must ask you for two items.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002994	The first is Dimensional Essence. That will be easy to find around here.{nl}The last one will be a problem...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002995	Defeat the demons and gather their magic source.{nl}After collecting both, come back here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002996	The protection crystals are under attack!{nl}Since all of the library's energy is directed towards the trap, there is only one protection crystal guarding this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002997	If the protection crystals are not working, Giltine will still be able to escape even if we seal her within our trap.{nl}Take this tool and until the protection crystals are recharged fight off the demons!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002998	Thank you! And Neringa has returned as well.{nl}I will go and help with Vaivora's seal.  I'm grateful for your help!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002999	Vaivora has finished her seal for Giltine.{nl}Unfortunately, Giltine will not appear this time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003000	Please remain calm and do as Vaivora instructed.{nl}Come back to Neringa when the work there is done.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003001	Neringa is preparing for the next plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003002	That is a record. Neringa will give it back to Vaivora.{nl}Right now you must deal with the embarrassed Goddess of Knowledge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003003	Goddess Vaivora know much more than you or Neringa, expect for the future.{nl}Therefore it is impossible to convince Vaivora.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003004	Vaivora will now make an extreme choice.{nl}Give up the revelation and remove Giltine from this world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003005	She still thinks that is correct.{nl}In the meantime, let's move to Valandis Room 3.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003006	There you and Neringa will listen to the Goddess plans and follow.{nl}Neringa will go first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003007	Goddess Vaivora has instructed you to collect all the magical energy that can be used on the alter for the seal.{nl}There are devices around the library that you can collect the magic from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003008	Please activate them.{nl}The activated magic devices will go where they are needed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003009	There was a human who came here without an invitation.{nl}But you are the first to be formally invited.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003010	That looks like enough.{nl}Also, Neringa is looking for you. It would be good if you go.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003011	I will finish the rest of the work here.{nl} I will be off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003012	I'm surprised by your work. Human potential seems to know no bounds.{nl}To play a part in continuing human history, I will tell you something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003013	Several hundred years ago, Demon Goddess Giltine had already invaded this place.{nl}She was looking for a record of herself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003014	But at the time she could not obtain it.{nl}So she comes again today.{nl}I do not know where she will use it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003015	But she is coming to this place soon to get her hands on that record.{nl}We have taken advantage of her greed by preparing a trap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003016	As she becomes overcome with joy for finally getting her hands on the record, she will disappear from this world.{nl}If she disappears from this world, every problem will be solved.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003017	All of the Goddesses will return to their rightful places and you too may go home.{nl}For this I need you help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003018	My Kupole are in the final stages of perfecting the trap.{nl}Please help them. I also have last minute preparations.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003019	Once again, thank you for your courage and you sacrifice.{nl}For the sake of the world, please endure just a little bit longer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003020	Please collect them quickly!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003021	Kupole Danute is still unfocused. This may be a handful for a human such as yourself.{nl}But if you have nothing else to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003022	Vaivora wants to destroy a part of the Fantasy Library in order to block future entry.{nl}But it will not go according to the Goddess' wish.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003023	It's quite unfortunate... To ensure that the prediction comes true, you must artfully disrupt the Goddess' plan.{nl}And Goddess must not know what you and Neringa are the ones to blame.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003024	So follow the Goddess' plan for awhile.{nl}When it is time to execute our own plan, Neringa will call you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003025	To sacrifice a part of the district to capture Giltine.{nl}Vaivora's plan seems reckless.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003026	Vaivora will ask you to activate the sealing device set up in Valandis Room 3.{nl}Go about the task.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003027	Neringa will also do as such.{nl}Go to Vaivora.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003028	Neringa will call you when it is time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003029	Time is running out and there are not many Kupoles remaining that I can call...{nl}You will be able to help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003030	Here Skywa is helping me to operate the Bluenode Collapsing Device.{nl}But the energy from this device is calling demons to it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003031	Please go there and protect the device for me.{nl}If we lose even one, Giltine will slip away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003032	It hurts me as well to make such a decision.{nl}And I will bear this crime for eternity.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003033	But to save the world from Giltine's grip...{nl}It's an expensive sacrifice that must be done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003034	Amazing!{nl}The activated collapsing device will conceal its magic, and will not face attack again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003035	Now Skywa will activate the collapsing device remotely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003036	Next we need to activate the second collapsing device.{nl}However, it does not have enough energy to run.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003037	Gather the Gigantic magic source around the area of the second collapsing device.{nl}After that, listen to Meringa about what to do next.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003038	I will return after surveilling Valandis Room 91.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003039	I will not be gone long.{nl}However, while I am away please consult Neringa if you need help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003040	Our goal is to cause the Blanorth collapsing device to overload.{nl}Until then we will continue to follow Vaivora's plan, so as to not alert suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003041	Kupole Skywa is walking around and managing the collapsing devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003042	Operating them is simple enough. Insert the Gigantic magic source that you have in your possession into the device.{nl}As the device re-energizes, protect it until it can conceal its magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003043	Right now the Goddess is checking on Demon Goddess Giltine's rampage in Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003044	As pressing as the matter is, the Goddess will not use the Fantasy Library as a burial ground for Giltine.{nl}Please follow the plan thoughtfully and reliably.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003045	You have successfully energized the device.{nl}It's good to know the plan is right on schedule.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003046	Giltine is currently in Valandis Room 91 searching frankly for the revelation.{nl}Let us finally finish the task before us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003047	Now, there are only a few devices left to run.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003048	But is there enough time to leave everything to Skywa... And it would be difficult to protect.{nl}Would you be willing to help Skywa?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003049	Make you way to Ballandans collapsing device.{nl}Skywa will be waiting for you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003050	The human helping Vaivora is you?{nl}This is my first time seeing one, but you seem particularly strong.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003051	I have a job for you...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003052	Not too long ago, I set the Ballandans Collapsing Device.{nl}I was going activate another devicce here as well, but the demons swarmed me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003053	If I waste my time on them, I won't be able to finish the work Vaivora gave me.{nl}How about clearing demons from around the Ballandans collapsing device?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003054	You just need to protect it until the device is set and conseals itself...{nl}While you deal with this, I'll be able to go and finish my other remaining tasks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003055	Thank you so much! Humans are so kind, no?{nl}Alright, I'm going to go finish my other preparations. I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003056	Your help is appreciated. Thanks to you, Skywa was able to complete the rest of the preparations.{nl}Now only Balanorth collapsing device is left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003057	Shall I give this remaining task to you?{nl}When all is ready, just turn on the device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003058	Oh, right Neringa was looking for you. It seems she also needs your help.{nl}I'll wait here for your successful return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003059	Everything has been prepared.{nl}And Vaivora has no reason to distrust you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003060	You received the request to handle the Balanorth collapsing device, no?{nl}When go to run that device, the head monsters will appear and interrupt you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003061	When the head monsters are defeated they will release great amounts of energy.{nl}We will use that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003062	Please lure the head monsters closer to the Balanorth device and defeat them there.{nl}Their released energy will overheat the device and destroy it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003063	Then Vaivora's mission will fail in its final step.{nl}Once you have completed this task, you and Neringa will go together to Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003064	Please do not forget.{nl}You must defeat the head monsters when they are nearest to the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003065	All of history is recorded in Fantasy Library. Of course, records about you are also here.{nl}This is a situation where a human is involved in both Goddess and demon history.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003066	But, sadly, it will not be recorded.{nl}Neringa has destroyed all records of your involvement.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003067	Vaivora has sensed that something has gone wrong.{nl}She believed all to be finished.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003068	But right now there is no reason to care about her.{nl}Neringa will head towards Valandis Room 91 first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003069	Inform Vaivora that the plan has failed.{nl}Then you must come straight to Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003070	Neringa will wait for you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003071	How did it turn out like this?{nl}The device isn't responding.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003072	You've failed me.{nl}Now I see the human limit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003073	I was stupid...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003074	But it's not your fault.{nl}It was my fault for giving such an important task to a human.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003075	I...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003076	The Next plan is...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003077	To stop Giltine I could...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003078	Everywhere has become polluted and ruined by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}Vaivora, before she destroys everything, us included, you must take action.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003079	It's no use.{nl}There is no way a human can compete against a Demon God..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003080	However, a human chosen by Laima may be different.{nl}I wish not to put you harm's way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003081	But I need you to buy us some time until the Kupole and I can figure out how to trap Giltine.{nl}Right now, this is our best plan..
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003082	Demon Goddess Giltine is summoning her demons to Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003083	Neringa is sure she is residing there.{nl}You need to stop Giltine before she gets her hands on the revelation and escapes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003084	To do this you must destroy the dimensional doors used to summon the demons.{nl}Then, you and Neringa will need to prepare a way to keep you safe from Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003085	But first, destroy the doors.{nl}This incident is coming to an end just as the Goddess predicted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003086	And your role has become more important.{nl}Neringa will make the necessary preparations and, during this time, destroy as many dimensional doors as possible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003087	We have almost reached where Demon God Giltine is residing.{nl}Nearby is the revelation Goddess Laima prepared for Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003088	Giltine has already burned her way through the library to reach that one revelation.{nl}And Goddess Laima has said that you also must be there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003089	Stay near Neringa. Neringa will keep you safe.{nl}But you must also keep Neringa safe from the demon minions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003090	Now let us follow Giltine.{nl}Now we only need to follow Giltine.{nl}Stay close. If you get too far away from Neringa, you will be struck by Giltine's power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003091	Goddess Laima spoke of a day where Giltine's black wings will be broken.{nl}But this is not that day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003092	From here forward, you will face Giltine alone.{nl}Neringa did not appear in the final scene of Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003093	Under the black wing's shadow is the future.{nl}suppress your fear and continue forward.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003094	Fate, itself, will protect you.{nl}Go forth, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003095	You have successfully fulfilled Goddess Laima's prediction.Then, Neringa's role here is done.{nl}But the journey for you has not come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003096	Now that this is over, Goddess Laima wished to guide you to Astral Tower.{nl}At the tower will be a revelation for you to find.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003097	At Astral Tower there will be new hardships and revelations waiting for you.{nl}However, all of this follows from Goddess Laima. You will be safe.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003098	Before leaving, report to Vaivora that the revelation was not retrieved.{nl}And that Neringa has also left.{nl}She will not ask you why.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003099	I see.. this is how things turned out.{nl}I appreciate your courage and sacrifice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003100	This is the second time I have missed Giltine in my own library.{nl}It seems Laima and my sisters will berate me for this..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003101	I knew that Neringa would leave eventually.{nl}She was always around but her presence was never imposing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003102	If we meet again, there is much I want to ask.{nl}But it will have to wait until the world is freed from Giltine's grasp.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0400_20180305_003112	To be frank, record of Taniel the Second's funeral{nl}are extremely sparse{nl}which lends extra credibility to these claims.{nl}That is because the other funerals{nl}had some sort of records{nl}no matter how small.{nl}However, even if these claims are true{nl}the Mausoleum will never see the light of day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180305_003113	The location of the secret mausoleum remains hidden{nl}for it is almost impossible to avoid{nl}the gaze of  Goddess Medeina.{nl}That is why even if the rumors are true, it is likely that it will remain just a legend.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180320_003114	Goddess Medeina used the trees to sow a song that she could pass on to the priests.{nl}The priests would then break down the metaphorical lyrics to grasp the Goddess' true meaning.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003131	What a surprise to find a visitor in Nicopolis.{nl}{nl}Why am I surprised, you say?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003132	Yes! Nicopolis is a city of wizards, built by and for wizards.{nl}In its glory days, the city used to be the center for the study of magic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003133	But curiosity got the better of them and their studies resulted in the elimination of all life in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003134	Years after the incident, people returned to the city and life began anew, but the city was damaged once again during Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003135	It was also during Medzio Diena that the magical prowess of the city's residents brought out the evil magic forces that were sealed within the city.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003136	Some left the city behind, but most stayed as they knew that other cities were already filled with refugees and there would be no room for them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003137	Owyn Dilben, a Court Mage who is a distant relative of mine, has asked me to try and suppress the evil magic in the city of Nicopolis.{nl}I have nothing but respect for that man, so I could not refuse his favor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003138	{nl}But I was not strong enough to suppress the evil magic on my own.{nl}{nl}I found people who would help me in my quest, but it seems I'm still short of manpower for the task.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003139	You will help me?{nl}I am grateful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003140	Nicopolis is quarantined from the outside world with Barrier Stones around the city.{nl}I thought that the monsters here were more ferocious than in other areas because of this barrier.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003141	I did some investigating and found some structures in Starry Town that were radiating with ominous energy.{nl}My guess is that this energy is agitating the monsters here.{nl}I want to suppress the energy radiating from the structures. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003142	Traveler. Could you use these Magic Block scrolls on the sculptures in Starry Town to nullify the evil energy they radiate?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003143	I will entrust you to deal with the sculptures in the Magic Shop District, Starry Town Square, and Magija Lot.{nl}I will go use the scrolls in the remaining areas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003144	Let's meet back at Represijos Street when we're done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003145	Looks like the sculpture is protected by something. Investigate its surroundings.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003146	The structure seems to be protected by a device nearby. Inject the device with a ball of electricity to overload it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003147	The structure is immune to magic but a strange device rose up from the ground.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003148	Looks like you have to enter a password to unlock the device and remove the sculpture's barrier.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003149	You need to investigate the Raktas Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003150	Investigate the Raktas Intersection.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003154	I lost him at the Raktas Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003155	This is a difficult task for me because I've never tracked down a possessed person during my career as a detective.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003156	Since the incident here, all life has been eliminated in Nicopolis.{nl}But, still, I feel as if the spirits of those who died here still linger in the city.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003158	If you're thinking of moving to Nicopolis, I would have to try and stop you.{nl}You're not safe here, not even within these city limits.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003159	A city of wizards sounds fascinating on paper, but, in reality, it isn't.{nl}All these objects moving about on their own make this place look haunted.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003161	I am doing my best to get to the bottom of the bizarre occurrences in Feline Post Town, but it's not an easy task.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003168	The city looks peaceful on the outside, but it isn't really.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003169	The city has been plagued by evil magic forces since Medzio Diena.{nl}Even the monsters are lured to the city because of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003170	The people of Nicopolis seem to have fallen under the influence of the evil magic.{nl}I've even seen some people collapse in the streets for no good reason.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003171	The wizards are trying to come up with a solution, but their efforts haven't been all that fruitful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003172	The people of Nicopolis live in fear that monsters may invade the town.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003175	Leave me be unless you have business here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003176	At times I had felt I was being controlled by someone or something...{nl}It turns out that I was really under the control of a wizard of Nicopolis' past.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003177	It pains me to think that I have caused others suffering because of my condition.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003178	I will summarize our findings on the Feline Post Town case and report to Owyn Dilben.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003179	Wizard Nidia
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003180	Nicopolis was a place I've only read about in books. It's a rather bleak and eerie place even with all these people living here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003181	I am in awe of the wizards of the past for having built such a city.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003182	But it was very amateurish of them to have lost control over the city like they did.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003183	Wizard Aldoni
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003184	We are under the orders of Owynia Dilben to look after the Barrier Stones in Spell Tome Town.{nl}These days we are investigating the sudden increase in the number of monsters around the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003185	The magic forces that surround the city of Nicopolis have a negative influence on its people.{nl}We look after the Barrier Stone that suppresses the negative energy to some extent.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003186	Wizard Ane
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003187	There weren't many monsters when we first arrived.{nl}The monsters grew in number since we started looking after the Barrier Stones.{nl}Thankfully, we have never been attacked by them but we live in fear that they could strike at any moment.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003188	If it wasn't for what happened in the past, Nicopolis would have been a great city.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003189	No matter what happens when you switch the Old Research Papers with the fake documents, come back to Avarija Street.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003190	I must follow the tracking spell on the Quipmage and stop him from performing the ritual.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003191	The Quipmage almost had me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003192	I never knew I would end up fighting monsters...{nl}I didn't know this job would get so dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003193	We could stop the Quipmage because Aldoni chased after him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003194	It seems to be locked because of the devices found near it.{nl}Try turning them off. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003195	The device is empty. The Quipmage must have taken the papers already.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003196	Removing the crystal from the magic circle could unlock it. Ask Nidia for a way to remove the crystal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003197	Can't see if the Old Research Papers are still here because the device is locked. Investigate the area and find a way to unlock it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003198	You're here.{nl}{nl}I've researched the sculptures while using the Magic Block scroll.{nl}The sculptures were put up by the Pervading Queen to watch over and experiment on the city's people.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003199	I don't know what kind of experiment, but there are records that these structures were used to take control of people's wills.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003200	If we use the Magic Block scroll on this sculpture we will be able to suppress the influence of sculptures all over town and calm the monsters down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003201	Monsters?{nl}They attacked while you were trying to use the scrolls?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003202	We must be careful then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003203	They really did attack...{nl}It was as if they were protecting the structures.{nl}Without your help I would have died, traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003204	I sense powerful magic coming from the clock tower in Starry Town Square.{nl}I've never felt such powerful magic before.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003205	This does not bode well.{nl}Let's go have a look.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003206	No... There seems to be a problem with the Barrier Stones...{nl}Looks like we need to go check up on them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003207	Thank you.{nl}We may be attacked by even stronger monsters now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003208	If a monster appears, don't hesitate to run away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003209	The Pervading Queen appeared?{nl}I've put you in danger again, traveler. I am sorry.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003210	I'm glad to hear that you are alright.{nl}So, the Pervading Queen told you to stop meddling in her affairs?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003211	Owyn Dilben has found that the old leaders of Nicopolis now roam the lands as monsters.{nl}These leaders now have taken the form of the Teal Specter, the Quipmage, and the Pervading Queen, who you've already come across.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003212	Owyn Dilben has not only suppressed their magic but he also made sure that they won't escape Nicopolis and wreak havoc on the world.{nl}He has put me in charge of the duties before he left.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003213	I am impressed that you defeated the Pervading Queen, one of the ancient figures of power in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003214	Excuse me for saying so, but perhaps you would help me track down and defeat the ancient beings of the city.{nl}So that the people of Nicopolis can live in peace.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003216	Have you been to the Starry Town Square?{nl}There's a big clock tower there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003217	I've heard that the stairs leading to the top of the clock tower are made of stars.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003218	Being a wizard myself, I was curious as to how the stairs were made.{nl}But I could never go take a look myself because I can sense powerful magic in the area. I'm afraid there could be a monster or a trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003219	I wanted to ask someone to help me gather the material that makes up the starry stairs.{nl}But asking others of things I can't do myself would just be rude, wouldn't it?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003220	It saddens me that I won't ever find out what those stairs are made of.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003221	Really?{nl}That would be wonderful!{nl}Here. Please gather the materials using this bottle.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003222	Please gather the materials that make up the starry stairs of the clock tower in Starry Town Square using this special bottle.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003224	Nicopolis Guard
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003225	A traveler here in Nicopolis...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003226	I'm not trying to poke fun at you, it's just that this place is dangerous and we don't see many travelers.{nl}It was rude of me but I was surprised to see someone visiting the city alone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003227	I am the guard in charge of watching over Starry Town.{nl}Being on guard duty isn't easy what with all the monsters and strange devices lying about.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003228	Able wizards are in charge of defending the city from evil magic and I warn the people of the city not to mess around with the devices.{nl}But the monsters keep appearing no matter how many times I chase them away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003229	Watch out for monsters on your travels.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003230	Nicopolis Guard
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003231	You want to help?{nl}Are you sure about that?{nl}The monsters these days are more ferocious than ever, you could hurt yourself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003232	Hmm... If you say so yourself. I will accept your offer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003233	If you can't seem to handle the monsters, just tell me.{nl}I'd rather that I work harder than to see you get hurt out there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003234	You've defeated the monsters...{nl}Are you a mercenary or a soldier by trade?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003235	I wish I could offer you a job in guarding Nicopolis with me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003236	Are you a new settler?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003237	Oh... A traveler.{nl}I warn you not to stay too long in Feline Post Town.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003238	Those who caused the past incident at Nicopolis now roam the streets of Feline Post Town as monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003239	The Teal Specter is the worst of them all.{nl}He is now an evil spirit that possesses the townsfolk to suck the life force out of them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003240	Why don't we do anything about him?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003241	Owyn Dilben had tried to locate the Teal Specter himself, but because of the incident in the past and Medzio Diena it had become very difficult to track down a spirit in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003242	With help from the Exorcist Master, he had created a Detecting Solution that could detect the presence of the Teal Specter. But the solution can only be used once.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003243	Owyn Dilben hired me, a detective, to track down the victim possessed by the Teal Specter.{nl}For now I have narrowed it down to twelve suspects.{nl}I need to further narrow down the number of suspects to two, but it's not going to be easy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003244	You'd better leave before the Teal Specter gets you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003245	You want to help me?{nl}Fine.{nl}The more the merrier, I guess.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003246	I want to investigate the people who arrived in Feline Post Town around the time of the incident.{nl}I'll need the Resident Logs for that. We will need the secretary's assistance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003247	Go and ask him for the Resident Logs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003248	The Resident Logs?{nl}Sigh...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003249	I need to be truthful with you.{nl}I was being careless and lost the Resident Logs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003250	I opened the window to let in some fresh air and the Resident Logs were blown out the window by the wind.{nl}I looked everywhere for the logs but some pages have been eaten by monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003251	I need to retrieve the Resident Logs but I don't have the power to fight the monsters...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003252	My heart is heavy because of all that's happened because of me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003253	That's right.{nl}These are the lost Resident Logs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003254	I will let you borrow the Resident Logs if you need it for your investigation.{nl}You can give them back to me after you're done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003255	Let's check the Resident Logs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003256	You've found Resident Logs?{nl}I am relieved that you did.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003257	The people who moved in around the time of the incident are Ced, Efo, Fog, Gogh, Kelly and Leslie.{nl}Looks like we narrowed the number of suspects down to six.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003258	Bace is an eyewitness.{nl}Go get his testimony for me. He should be at the Keista Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003259	Auguste Dupin must have sent you.{nl}I'll tell you everything I saw.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003260	The night was so dark that I could not go out without a torch.{nl}It was when I was heading towards the Keista Intersection on my watch duty that I heard someone moaning.{nl}I headed over to where the sound was coming from and found a well-built man afloat in midair.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003261	I screamed out loud.{nl}Then someone who was hiding in the dark started running away towards the Raktas Intersection.{nl}I chased him thinking that he could be a suspect in the Feline Post Town Case.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003262	He was too fast so I couldn't keep up with him.{nl}I threw my torch at him in the hopes of stopping him but the fire from the torch just burnt his clothes slightly and I lost him at the Raktas Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003263	I lost the suspect at the Raktas Intersection.{nl}This is all I can tell you, unfortunately.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003264	Possible clues?{nl}All I had was the clothes I gave you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003265	You can smell the chemicals on the clothes.{nl}Perhaps you'll find something if you investigate this smell further.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003266	We want to identify the chemical found on the clothing.{nl}In order for that, we need the Ingredy Powder found on Mimorats. Could you get some for us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003267	I will make preparations for the investigation while you fetch the Ingredy Powder.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003268	I have finished making the necessary preparations.{nl}Let's find out what this chemical really is.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003269	The chemical extracted from the clothes are the chemicals used in making dyes.{nl}I saw the town chemist working with such chemicals.{nl}He is the primary suspect for now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003270	I can feel that we're getting closer to finding the possessed.{nl}You will be able to find the chemist in Irodymai Trade District.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003271	{nl}I will go ahead and question him first.{nl}I am sure that the chemist will lead us one step closer to finding the possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003272	He tried to run but I caught him.{nl}We almost lost him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003273	Let's interrogate the chemist about the possession.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003274	Let's interrogate the chemist.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003275	After hearing his testimony, I am certain that the chemist is not possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003276	The chemist spoke of an artist and a woman named Kelly.{nl}The two of them could have the access to such chemicals.{nl}We should spray them both with the Detecting Solution and find out who is possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003277	Let's spray the suspects with the Detecting Solution and find out who is possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003278	We must perform an exorcism on the possessed to lure out the Teal Specter.{nl}Why don't you prepare a seal around the suspect's house while I call for an exorcist?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003279	You've done it.{nl}I have brought an exorcist with me as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003280	Let's go.{nl}The exorcist is performing the ritual on Pabegti Street.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003281	What happened to the Teal Specter?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003282	We've finally vanquished the Teal Specter.{nl}Thanks to you, the Feline Post Town Case has finally been closed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003283	A traveler in Nicopolis...{nl}It isn't safe around here because of all that evil magic and monsters and whatnot. Many people are leaving the town because of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003284	Us? We take care of the Barrier Stones in Spell Tome Town by the request of Ownynia Dilben.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003285	As of recent, we've been investigating the growing number of monsters in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003286	You will help us?{nl}It's always good to have an extra pair of hands.{nl}There is a magical device in the Spell Tome Empty Lot and we suspect that this device is causing the number of monsters to grow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003287	Let's head out to the Spell Tome Lot and investigate.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003288	Seeing how the monsters attacked when we approached the device, it is now certain that device is calling the monsters to this area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003289	Let's check the device to see what exactly it is that draws them here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003290	Did you see that?{nl}That was the Beholder and the Quipmage.{nl}Who is the Quipmage you ask?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003291	The Quipmage is one of the central figures that caused the deaths of millions at Nicopolis.{nl}I've heard Owynia Dilben mention him before but it's my first time seeing him for myself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003292	Having seen him talking to the Beholder in the form of a monster, there is no doubt that the Quipmage is planning something sinister.{nl}We need to stop them.{nl}I'll talk to my colleagues about this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003293	Aldoni told me just now.{nl}We all agreed to stop the Quipmage. We believe that he is up to no good.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003294	Our plan is to find the Quipmage's Old Research Papers.{nl}Ane suggested that he probably scattered them around various locations.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003295	Ane also made this Micro Magic Detector on the grounds that the papers will also be radiating with the Quipmage's evil magic.{nl}We will use this device to switch the original papers with the Forged Papers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003296	Using the Micro Magic Detector will display the areas that possibly hide the Quipmage's papers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003297	There are eight areas in total.{nl}We'll check the areas to the south.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003298	Please go check the Residential Area, Tyrimai Lot and Magija Slove Square.{nl}Should any one of us be in trouble, let's meet back on Avarija Street.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003299	You think removing the crystal from the magic circle is going to unlock the device?{nl}Hold on. There may be a way to do that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003300	This is a Scroll of Gravity.{nl}Use this on the crystal and the crystal will float into the air.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003301	Use the Scroll of Gravity on the crystal to make the crystal float mid-air.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003302	Check the Residential Area, Tyrimai Lot and Magija Slove Square for the Quipmage's papers and replace them with the Forged Papers.{nl}Come back when you're done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003303	You've done it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003304	Magic, for Nicopolis, was the driving force behind both its success and demise.{nl}This city is a warning of sorts to all those who study the arcane arts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003305	The city is a site of the devastating accident caused by those that were blinded by their own glory and quest for knowledge beyond their comprehension.{nl}What we are looking at is more than just the remnants of a bygone era.{nl}The city itself is a site of learning.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003306	I want to study the city in order to learn what it has to teach.{nl}Through what I've learned, I want to guide the people and provide them better a future for the good of the entire Kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003307	These are the thoughts that run through my head when in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003308	Magic gives us convenience, but at times it is a force that can destroy us.{nl}At long last I've finally come to understand the weight of the responsibilities that I have as a wizard here in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003309	Chronomancer Ramute
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003310	Nicopolis may be a glorious achievement in the eyes of wizards, but at the same time, it is a stern warning.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003311	The buildings of Nicopolis have remained the same for hundreds of years.{nl}They seem unfazed by all that's happened here in the past.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003312	We are all doing our part in trying to revitalize the city of Nicopolis alongside Owynia Dilben.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003313	Many have left the city again after Medzio Diena.{nl}But there are still many at work to make this city great once again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003314	There are rumors that the people who caused the incident at Nicopolis are still roaming the lands in the form of monsters.{nl}Don't pay any mind to that, it's just a rumor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003315	There are many unidentified magic structures around the city.{nl}Some of them are known to cause trouble so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003316	It is the same for me.{nl}One half of my soul is still bound to the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003317	I do not know when I'll be gone.{nl}That's why I want to save as many Kupoles as possible while I still can.{nl}Right now, I can save them but I have no way of keeping the Kupoles safe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003318	{nl}We must protect the Kupoles until they regain their health.{nl}Head to the Baltinel Parish and collect the holy relics that used to belong to the believers of this city.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003319	{nl}The holy relics should be able to hide the Kupoles from the demons.{nl}After that, we'll go looking for other Kupoles.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003320	With your help, I was able to make preparations to hide the Kupoles.{nl}But there are still many Kupoles that are being hunted down by the demons.{nl}I know it's ridiculous for me to seek the help of a human.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003321	{nl}But could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003322	I will still need your help for now.{nl}So if you could help...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003323	{nl}Please follow me to the Gliehel Memorial.{nl}I beg of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003324	Thank you for coming.{nl}We may be able to help Zsaia and the Kupoles of the area with your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003325	I may have found Zsaia.{nl}She is at the entrance of the Gliehel Ranch area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003326	{nl}But... It seems she is being chased by demons.{nl}Before you contact Zsaia, please defeat the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003327	{nl}I can't give up just yet.{nl}I will hide the Kupole you brought to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003328	I can't trust a human.{nl}Get out of my way!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003329	We went through all that trouble for nothing...{nl}I am terribly sorry.{nl}I will hide this Kupole from the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003330	{nl}Protect my sisters...{nl}Help Grisia and Velad escape ...{nl}I am sorry I didn't trust you at first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003331	This is my last request...{nl}Please help them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003332	I can't believe that I've met my end falling into a demon's trap!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003333	Why are you following me?{nl}Leave me alone!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003334	Kupole Velad has gone away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003335	You're here. I've been waiting for you.{nl}The Supreme Commander and the others have already headed upstairs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003336	I will hold my position here and act as the base for the other Resistance members.{nl}I was going to send reinforcements to Byle as soon as the base was ready but I came across a problem.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003337	There is a trap that shoots arrows, which is stopping our men from moving forward.{nl}I need your help to solve this problem, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003338	Could you defeat the demons in the area so that our scouts can return safely?{nl}I will inspect the base while you are away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003339	The Astral Tower is full of traps that have been installed to keep the demons away.{nl}Our foremost priority should be to disarm these traps.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003340	But the Control Devices are hidden away to prevent such a thing from happening.{nl}It should be the same for the other floors as well. There may even be other traps that we are not aware of.{nl}But we cannot back down now.{nl}We must protect Lydia Schaffen's Astral Tower, whatever it takes.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003341	Thank you.{nl}The scouts could return safely because of your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003342	The scouts reported seeing demons in the Astral Tower that they've never seen before.{nl}They could be entering the tower through the portal on the first floor that Elder Ramunas has spoken of.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003343	According to the scouts, they spotted a red glow that looked like a portal in the Engine Room on 1F.{nl}Could you go and have a look for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003344	Elder Ramunas had mentioned that Ignas installed a portal somewhere on 1F.{nl}I remember that he said the portal lead to the Outer Wall District 13.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003345	When this fight is over, I must report to the Supreme Commander and have that area inspected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003346	We progressed this much while you were away investigating the portals. So the portals do exist...{nl}Now we know for sure that the demons are sending in their reinforcements through the portals.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003347	Elder Ramunas has provided us with the materials to make an explosive that could destroy the portal.{nl}But it will take some time for the explosive to be crafted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003348	I will give you the Portal Suppressors that the elder gave to me as plan B.{nl}Install it around the portals to weaken their power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003349	Destroying the portal would be our best bet in stopping the demons invading the tower...{nl}But we need to buy time to manufacture the explosive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003350	The suppressors will make it difficult for demons to use the portals.{nl}Please install the Portal Suppressors around the portals.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003351	You've come. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.{nl}We've just completed the explosive.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003352	Now, you will have to set the explosive near the portals.{nl}When it explodes, the magic that powers the portals will disappear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003353	We may fail to destroy all portals if there is a powerful demon or magic guarding the portals.{nl}I will give you some more suppressors just in case such a thing happens.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003354	Hopefully, the portals will be destroyed completely. But we should plan ahead in preparation for the worst case scenario.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003355	So it hasn't been removed completely.{nl}But it's okay. That should have drastically decreased the number of demons invading the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003356	I need you to help me with something while the Resistance soldiers fight the remaining demons near the portals.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003357	From the reports, we have found that the Control Device for the arrow trap is in the Command Room on 1F.{nl}The reports also said that the road to the Command Room is a perilous one full of demons and more traps.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003358	Could you go check the Command Room on 1F?{nl}Please defeat the monsters in the area as well to make way for the Resistance soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003359	The Astral Tower had always been an impregnable fortress in stopping the demon invasion.{nl}But now to see them enter the tower so freely... I am worried.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003360	You're back.{nl}Did you find the Defensive Device in the Command Room?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003361	So it is protected by a barrier...{nl}Then we should find a way to remove that barrier.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003362	It could either be the demons or the Schaffenstar that installed the barrier.{nl}We are currently out of materials to make more explosives.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003363	I guess the only thing left to do is use the Magic Stones carried by the demons to destroy the barrier.{nl}The Elder once told me that the Magic Stones that demons carry have small traces of magic in them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003364	I'm sure we will be able to make a new explosive that could blow up the barrier using these Magic Stones.{nl}Could you collect the Magic Stones for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003365	I am sure that we will be able to make powerful explosives out of these Magic Stones.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003366	You did it! Could you hold on a second?{nl}I will make the explosives for you right away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003367	This is an explosive made from the Magic Stones you've collected.{nl}You should set these explosives to remove the barrier protecting the Defensive Device and disarm the trap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003368	We, the Resistance, will defeat the demons on the way up to the next floor.{nl}But I must warn you that it's going to take some time for the explosives to go off because they were made using Magic Stones. The demons will try to stop you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003369	We will fight off the demons located on the way to the next floor up while you disarm the trap.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003370	The trap has been disarmed.{nl}Now the Resistance will be able to minimize our losses!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003371	We've done everything we could on the first floor.{nl}Let's move on to the next floor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003372	Instead of 2F, we will take the path straight for 4F that the Elder has prepared for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003373	I will remain here to take care of the remaining demons and to make sure other Resistance members can make it safely to 4F.{nl}I have marked your map with the Supreme Commander's location.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003374	You must be the Revelator! We've been expecting you.{nl}This must mean that Kron has successfully taken over 1F.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003375	The security here in 4F has been tightened.{nl}The demons must know that 1F has fallen to the Resistance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003376	But we cannot give up just yet. We must take back the Astral Tower.{nl}Revelator. I will tell you what you need to do next.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003377	According to our scouts, the Defensive Device here is made up of two parts.{nl}I've been told there is a poison gas trap in the area, as well as arrows.{nl}You must be cautious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003378	We sent our men to scout the Second Control Room to have a closer look.{nl}Could you have a look at the First Control Room for us?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003379	Please defeat the demons on your way there to help the Resistance members who are on their way up from the floor below.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003380	As I've told you already, the Astral Tower is full of dangerous traps.{nl}But I've never heard of a poison trap before. I am perplexed as to who prepared such a thing...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003381	You've defeated the demons nearby.{nl}Now please investigate the First Control Room.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003382	You've returned. Our scouts have also returned from the Second Control Room.{nl}Let's discuss our next plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003383	Having heard both your reports, it seems that the First Control Room is not as tightly guarded as the Second.{nl}The demons there seem a bit less well trained.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003384	Could you defeat the demons in the First Control Room and shut down the Defensive Device there?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003385	Hmm... But now I realize that there is no way that the demons will let their guard down this easy.{nl}There must be something that we're overlooking.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003386	Oh, so the guardian of the Control Room had the Defensive Device Lever.{nl}Even if we get to the Defensive Device, we won't be able to disarm it without that lever...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003387	Thank you for your help. Now the arrow trap has been disarmed.{nl}But the poison gas trap is still blocking our path.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003388	Since the lever was kept separately, it is most likely that the demons are doing the same to defend the Second Control Room as well.{nl}We'll need more information.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003389	Could you collect any items that could give us a clue to the workings of the defense system of the Second Control Room?{nl}Report back when you've gathered enough information.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003390	Ignas is cunning, cold-hearted, and cautious.{nl}From what we've gathered, we can tell that disarming the trap in the Second Control Room won't be an easy task.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003391	This is... An instruction? And it's written in our language and not in the language of demons.{nl}And you said you got it from a Naste? Hmm...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003392	{nl}Thank you for that.{nl}We need anything we can get our hands on, I'll have a read.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003393	According to the instruction, the Second Device Lever is hidden in the Storage Room on 4F.{nl}Could you locate the hidden lever in the Storage Room?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003394	But the Storage Room has a guardian just like in the First Control Room.{nl}You will need to prepare yourself for a fight. I will go to the Second Control Room with the Resistance soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003395	We will march onwards regardless of all the tricks Ignas has up his sleeves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003396	I've warned my men to be cautious in avoiding the traps... It's embarrassing to have fallen into one myself.{nl}But thanks to you, Revelator, my life has been spared.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003397	I was the first to arrive in the Second Control Room but others couldn't make it because of the demons and traps.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003398	Could you buy us some time to regroup and have our soldiers healed up?{nl}Please defeat the monsters in the passageway and wait for us in the room opposite to the Training Area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003399	You will be able to use the elevator to 12F that the Elder has prepared once you pass the Training Area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003400	That room will be the rendezvous point. Go defeat the demons in the area and wait for us there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003401	Defeat the monsters on the way to 12F and wait for us at the rendezvous point.{nl}The rendezvous point is the room opposite the Training Area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003402	I will lead my men there as soon as we are done regrouping.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003403	You've done it. Thank you.{nl}I want to move to the rendezvous point but there are still some men who need to recover.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003404	Go ahead and wait for me there.{nl}I will follow you as soon as our men have regrouped.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003405	You've come. I've captured Henika on my way here but he seems to be acting strangely.{nl}I expected him to run away when I saw him but instead, he challenged me to a duel.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003406	I thought he was acting rather suspicious so I shot him with an arrow that nullifies all magic effects and he collapsed to the ground.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003407	I've prepared this arrow to use when fighting a powerful demon and didn't expect it to affect Henika...{nl}I'm sorry, I was caught up in my train of thought and forgot to thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003408	Thank you for protecting us from the enemy's ambush.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003409	We can finally move to 12F but before we do I need to talk to you.{nl}Is that okay with you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003410	I almost forgot to tell you this because of Henika but I learned that there are other Elders in the tower between 12F and 20F.{nl}And Ignas, my sworn enemy, is at the observatory on 21F.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003411	I also found this key while searching Henika's body.{nl}I don't know what this is for, but I will hold on to it in case we need it in the future.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003412	Now, I should get back to preparing for 12F.{nl}You will also need time to prepare so tell me when you feel ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003413	Medic
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003414	Ah, Revelator... I know you're busy but could you help me?{nl}I am a medic for the Resistance. My job is to tend to injured soldiers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003415	There are many Resistance soldiers poisoned by the gas trap on the 4th floor.{nl}I need to concoct a cure for these men but ingredients are scarce.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003416	I am sure that the demons in these areas carry something they use to cure the poison with.{nl}Could you help me find the cure for the sake of the Resistance?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003417	First the arrows and now the poison gas...{nl}My heart hangs heavy seeing my comrades fall as we march onwards.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003418	This is a Schaffenstar Emergency Med...! And the Naste had these?{nl}How could they have gotten a hold of this?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003419	Thanks to you, now I can cure the poisoned soldiers. Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003420	I know it's suspicious, but we can't help but agree to his terms as we have no other choice.{nl}Revelator. Do not hesitate to back away when you find something suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003421	Elder Adaux
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003422	Thank you for agreeing to my terms. Why don't we begin with disarming the Defensive Device for the arrow trap?{nl}You will find a room that was once used as a Schaffenstar Member's Lounge nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003423	There are two Control Devices that hide the Defensive Device for the arrow trap.{nl}Demons in the area should have the lever for those devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003424	Defeat them to find the Control Device Levers.{nl}Use the two levers to reveal the Defensive Device that controls the arrow trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003425	Adaux has asked that you retrieve the two Control Device Levers from the demons in the Member's Lounge.{nl}Use the levers on the Devices to reveal the Defensive Device for the arrow trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003426	We'll do what he says for now because he knows the area very well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003427	The Control Terminals have been shut down.{nl}If Adaux was telling the truth, we should be able to see the First Defensive Device for the arrow trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003428	Adaux said that the First Defensive Device for the arrow trap can be found in the Control Room near the entrance.{nl}There are guardians in the area who have the levers that are required to shut down the Defensive Device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003429	Adaux has deployed demons towards the Control Room to trick Ignas into thinking he's still working for him.{nl}Defeat the guardian at the Control Room to retrieve the lever and use it to shut down the Defensive Device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003430	If what Adaux has said is true, some of my comrades would have become...{nl}I can't believe it. If that is the truth... We're...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003431	We want to move as quickly as possible since the arrows have stopped{nl}but our soldiers can't seem to move any further because of this evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003432	Adaux said that he had a favor for you since you are free from the influence of the nefarious energy.{nl}He says that there is an invisible barrier that Ignas created on 12F.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003433	No one was able to get past 12F because of this invisible barrier and he wanted to see if you, the Revelator, were able to pass the barrier.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003434	I've never heard of this before but could you go have a look?{nl}And it would be great if you could defeat the demons in the area while you're at it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003435	An invisible barrier... I've never heard of this before.{nl}Then do you think it's the barrier that's spreading this nefarious energy throughout the tower?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003436	Ah, even you could not pass the invisible barrier.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003437	The invisible barrier must be removed at all costs if we want to get past 12F.{nl}Though we would still have to do something about the nefarious energy after the barrier's been removed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003438	We've investigated the area beforehand but did not find any device that seemed to control the barrier.{nl}Perhaps there are areas that we have not searched yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003439	Could you perhaps look for any anomalies in the area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003440	We cannot back down now, Revelator.{nl}We must find a way to remove the invisible barrier and the nefarious energy by any means necessary.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003441	I've been waiting for you, Savior.{nl}On this statue is my gift to you that will guide you in your most perilous hour.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003442	The mysterious girl you saw earlier will help you when you are faced with a great adversity.{nl}The girl's powers have now been restored with your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003443	Return to the invisible barrier that blocks your path, Savior.{nl}The mysterious girl is waiting for you there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003444	The girl will cleanse the area of the nefarious energy and open the way for your passage.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003445	Return to the invisible barrier that blocks your path.{nl}The mysterious girl is waiting for you there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003446	I felt my body getting lighter, you...{nl}Does this mean that you've removed the barrier?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003447	I don't know how you did it but even without the barrier, there are still many traps that hinder progress.{nl}Unless those traps are disarmed, I cannot escape from this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003448	For now, you should go tell your friends at the Resistance about this.{nl}They should now be able to progress a little further.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003449	I no longer feel the nefarious energy that's been weighing me down.{nl}Could it have disappeared when the barrier was removed?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003450	We couldn't have made it this far without you, Revelator.{nl}You've done a lot to help us. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003451	I heard you removed the invisible barrier. And the nefarious energy seems to have disappeared...{nl}Did you find the device to remove it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003452	Of course, I won't pry.{nl}But even if the trap on your side has been disarmed, there's still another trap here that's blocking the path.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003453	You will be able to find the Second Defensive Device in the Command Room on 12F. There is another guardian and the situation is the same as before.{nl}Find the Defensive Device Lever to disarm the trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003454	We will go to where Adaux is to see if he'll uphold his part of the bargain.{nl}Revelator, you should deactivate the Second Defensive Device to disarm the trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003455	I've told Byle what needs to be done in the upper floors before you arrived.{nl}You should talk to him for further instructions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003456	Ignas seems to have abandoned his humanity... He cannot be forgiven.{nl}Revelator. Let's move to 20F and defeat Ignas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003457	{nl}Take this before you go. Adaux wanted me to deliver this to you.{nl}I hope that this equipment will be of help to you, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003458	{nl}Adaux has also opened up a secret passage that will lead us to 20F.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003459	{nl}I will go ahead and set up camp on 20F.{nl}Follow the secret passage to 20F whenever you're ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003460	You've arrived.{nl}I have finished setting up camp here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003461	With Henika and Adaux gone, only Cezaris remains by Ignas' side. He should be feeling pretty anxious about now.{nl}First, I will tell you what needs to be done here based on what I've learned from Adaux.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003462	I'm relieved that our men seem relatively unharmed despite the ambush.{nl}Now I know for sure that Ignas is at his wit's end. This is our chance to strike!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003463	According to Adaux, the defenses on 20F are protected by 4 Protective Devices.{nl}Each device can be found in Schaffenstar Lodges 1 to 4 respectively.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003464	He said that each device is controlled in a different method.{nl}First, go to the Schaffenstar Lodges 1 and 2. Defeat the monsters there and disable the devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003465	Go to Schaffenstar Lodge 3 afterward and defeat the demons there to obtain the Suspicious Scrolls.{nl}Use the scrolls there to find the hidden magic source and destroy them to stop the Protective Device in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003466	There are demons in Schaffenstar Lodge 4 that act as a power source for the barriers for the Protective Device.{nl}Defeat the demons to remove the barrier and disable the device there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003467	There's a lot to remember so you may forget a few details here and there.{nl}If you do forget, come back and ask me again any time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003468	I will regroup the Resistance men here and fight off the demons in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003469	First, disable the protective devices in Schaffenstar Lodges 1 and 2.{nl}The demons there will try to stop you so clear the area before you disable the device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003470	Go to Schaffenstar Lodge 3 and obtain Suspicious Scrolls by defeating the demons there.{nl}Use the scrolls to look for a magic source in the area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003471	When you locate the magic source, destroy it and the barrier surrounding the Protective Device will weaken.{nl}That's when you will have to disable the Protective Device there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003472	In Schaffenstar Lodge 4, there are demons that act as a power source for the barriers for the Protective Device.{nl}Defeat the demons to weaken the barrier and disable the device there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003473	Now we can disable the Defensive Device.{nl}We should have no trouble doing so as the Protective Devices have all been disabled now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003474	The Defensive Device should be in the control room on 20F.{nl}But there will be a guardian protecting it like on the other floors.{nl}Defeat the guardian and disable the Defensive Device so that the traps are no longer functional.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003475	All there's left to do after that is to find and defeat Elder Cezaris and move onto 21F.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003476	We should look for Cezaris now. He should be in the Elder Chambers.{nl}Let's head towards the Elder Chambers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003477	After we deal with Cezaris, all the Elders of the Schaffenstar will have been removed.{nl}Ignas will be the last one left after this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003478	To see Ignas before my own eyes... It's almost over.{nl}What Adaux said was true. Some of the demons we fought were actually our comrades...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003479	But there's no time to look back now.{nl}We must end this once and for all and take back the Astral Tower for the sake of all of our fallen comrades.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003480	Revelator. It's time we faced Cezaris but there are some things that must be taken care of before we do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003481	Adaux has told us that we need five keys to move up to 21F.{nl}Three of the five keys are held by each Elder and the remaining two are in the two General Offices on 20F.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003482	We must first find those keys before we face Cezaris.{nl}Why don't we start with the nearest General Office on 20F?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003483	It's most likely that one of the demons in the area will be carrying the key.{nl}If you've found the key, go look for the second key in the Secondary General Office.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003484	To prevent theft, it is said that the keys are stored in a way where one key is required to find the other.{nl}Finding the first key will lead you to the second key in the Secondary General Office.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003485	Report to me when you've found the two keys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003486	In the past, Lydia Schaffen had prepared five keys that opened the passage to 21F of the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003487	Three of those keys were trusted to each of the three Elders and the remaining two were stored in the two General Offices on 20F.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003488	Usually, you would only need to have two keys from the General Offices to get to 21F. But in the case of special emergencies, the security mechanism is changed so that you need the keys of the three Elders to move up to 21F.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003489	We currently have two Elder keys.{nl}The remaining keys can all be found here on 20F.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003490	You've found one key. The other should be in the Secondary General Office.{nl}Use the key you've just found to find the next key.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003491	If there is a demon that reacts to the first key you've found, it's most likely the that the demon is holding the second key.{nl}Come back after you've found both keys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003492	We now have both keys.{nl}All we need now is the key that Cezaris holds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003493	Now we must face Cezaris. According to Adaux, Cezaris has turned himself into a demon completely.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003494	This will be a difficult fight, Revelator.{nl}I will give you three arrows to help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003495	It's weaker than the arrow that subdued Henika, but you will still be able to use these on Cezaris to weaken him temporarily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003496	We will deal with Ignas after we've taken care of Cezaris.{nl}The Resistance will clear the way to the Elder Chambers for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003497	It will be an arduous battle.{nl}After this, all that's left will be Ignas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003498	You must use the five keys on the Elevator Control Device in the Night Duty Office to get to 21F.{nl}The five keys are the there Elder keys and the two keys from the General Offices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003499	Thanks to your help we now have all five keys.{nl}Take these keys with you. Use them on the Elevator Control Device to activate the elevator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003500	Use the five keys and activate the elevator.{nl}Ignas is waiting for us on the next floor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003501	I was trying to set up camp before the fight with Ignas, but demon forces are too strong here. This way we'll...{nl}Could you help clear the area until we set up camp on 21F and the remaining Resistance forces arrive?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003502	Please buy us some time to set up camp here.{nl}I beg you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003503	It's important that we defeat Ignas, but there is one more thing we must take care.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003504	We must destroy the device that turns people into demons located somewhere in the Astral Tower.{nl}According to Adaux, this device turns Schaffenstar members into demons and gives power to Ignas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003505	If I am correct in guessing that this device collects magic energy and supplies it to Ignas, there may be a way to use this device to our advantage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003506	The fact that the device collects magic could only mean that an influx of magic will overload the machine and break it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003507	There's no harm in trying, so please collect some Magic Residue from the areas of the tower where magic runs strong.{nl}Search the areas with a glowing light and you will find the residue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003508	About 15 of the residues will be powerful enough. Collect 15 Magic Residues for me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003509	I've turned the idea around and came to the conclusion that if the machine is powered by magic,{nl}overloading it with magic will cause the machine to malfunction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003510	So please collect the residues for me.{nl}15 will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003511	You've done it. I will now tell you my plans to destroy the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003512	First, throw the Magic Residue you've collected into the device.{nl}I'm sure that will overload the device with magic and destroy it eventually.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003513	If there aren't enough residues to destroy the device the defense systems of the room will be activated.{nl}The defense system will make the machine excrete the remaining Magic Residues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003514	When that happens, please throw the excreted residue back in the machine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003515	While you disable the device, we will fight off any demons in the area that may interfere with your task.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003516	You will need to throw back the Magic Residues that are excreted from the machine.{nl}It was Adaux who taught me this method.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003517	Hopefully it won't come down to that,{nl}but think of this as a backup plan just in case something goes wrong.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003518	You've destroyed the device. Now we will be free from the suffering this machine creates.{nl}Thank you. Now... We must face Ignas at the First Observatory.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003519	Ignas should be waiting for us at the First Observatory.{nl}Perhaps there you will find the Revelation you are looking for.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003520	The Resistance will stay back and fight off any demons that may come to aid Ignas during the battle.{nl}I hope that you can defeat Ignas and find the Revelation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003521	If there's anything I've learned from watching you battle Cezaris and having landed that blow on Ignas, it's that I am no match for Ignas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003522	I must admit that I would have never made it this far if it wasn't for your help, Revelator.{nl}This will be the last favor I ask you... Defeat Ignas, he must be stopped.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003523	I knew Ignas wouldn't stand idle. The gatekeepers in front of the observatory...{nl}Now all that's left is to face Ignas himself. We're counting on you to defeat him, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003524	You've defeated Ignas!{nl}The Resistance has finally reclaimed the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003525	Did you find the Revelation? We got the Astral Tower back with your help but weren't you here looking for a Revelation?{nl}You should go look for it now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003526	I've long wanted to take back the Astral Tower. It pained me to see it suffer under Ignas' rule for all those years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003527	I am glad that I've met you and we could successfully reclaim the tower fighting alongside our comrades.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003528	I thank you once again for all that you've done to help us, Revelator.{nl}Without you, all of this wouldn't have been possible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003529	I will now work on rebuilding the Astral Tower with the remaining Resistance members and the Schaffenstar.{nl}I guess you'll be leaving to find your Revelation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003530	If ever on your journey you need our help, please come and see us.{nl}The Resistance will be there for you when you need us, Revelator. Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003531	You've done well. Adaux is looking for you.{nl}He is nearby, you should go talk to him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003532	The Resistance is now complete.{nl}The Schaffenstar and the Astral Tower are now free from the tyranny of evil.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003533	What I need to do now is to rebuild the Astral Tower and the Schaffenstar.{nl}I will work hard to make the Schaffenstar a great organization that it once was.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003534	You've found the levers. Go to the Second Control Room.{nl}I will join the other members and we will meet you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003535	An invisible barrier from which evil energy is radiating blocking the path.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003536	Ignas kept ignoring the demon infestation despite their growing numbers.{nl}That is no way for a man who calls himself leader to act. It is an outrage!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003537	The head of the Astral Tower was negligent of his duties of defending the tower from demons.{nl}That's why we left the tower to form the Resistance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003538	So that's what happened...{nl}Perhaps it was me who drove him to his death...{nl}I will ask the others to retrieve his body.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003539	But... The note said that the demons were freely let into the tower.{nl}It also says that Ignas may have joined forces with the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003540	Did you see all the demons walking around?{nl}The Resistance soldiers are having a hard time because of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003541	We're a little short-handed so I wouldn't dare to take care of them on my own.{nl}I know it's a difficult request, but would you give me a hand?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003542	The demons took over when the water points stopped functioning...{nl}Hopefully they'll start working again soon...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003543	I already see a lot fewer demons around!{nl}You're amazing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003544	There are many Water Facilities near the Starlit Lake.{nl}They were built to prevent the demons from entering the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003545	Those of us who felt like the problem was serious told Ignas that we should fight the demons and take back the Facilities...{nl}But he continued to act like everything was fine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003546	We hurried to check on the Water Facilities as soon as we were out...{nl}But most of them had already been destroyed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003547	Luckily there was one Facility still remaining, and that was 86 Waters...{nl}Although we're still struggling to drive away the demons, since we can't restart the water point.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003548	Elder Ramunas
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003549	So you're the Revelator Kron told me about?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003550	And these are the Water Facility Management documents.{nl}Very well. We should get our own Water Facility working soon with these.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003551	The Resistance army is outnumbered.{nl}And Ignas' army is made up of formidable soldiers, so there's no way we can win using only brute force.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003552	I was going over our tactics to confuse the enemies here.{nl}From what I've gathered, I've learned that there were many neutral forces in Ignas' rear camp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003553	They already know what I look like, but I think we can disguise you as a member of the Schaffenstar.{nl}You should be okay as long as you don't make a fuss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003554	And the documents only say that the controllers need a means for the magic reaction...{nl}Maybe it doesn't have to be Magic Stones!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003555	It's not easy for the Resistance to mobilize since there are too many demons and monsters.{nl}Could you defeat them for us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003556	Did you clear the area of demons and monsters?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003557	The number of demons and monsters has decreased noticeably.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003558	Oh, I almost forgot. My name is Morvio, I'm a student of the Ranger Master.{nl}She asked me to come and help the Resistance soldiers, so here I am.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003559	I saw it once when I was working inside the Tower.{nl}I'll never forget the awful energy I felt then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003560	But now... I can feel it again! It's the same energy, spreading all over the region!{nl}I think... Ignas must have taken the Essence of Ziburynas and given it to Pbeta.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003561	It is said that Lydia Schaffen defeated Demon Lord Ziburynas using an arrow called the Flechette.{nl}The Flechette is a bow created by the ancestors of the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003562	{nl}The current Fletcher Master also knows of a way to defeat a demon holding the Essence of Ziburynas.{nl}Could you visit the Fletcher Master and ask how?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003563	Oh, and the Fletcher Master said that he would send his apprentice but he has not arrived yet.{nl}It would be good if you could ask him about that as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003564	The Essence of Ziburynas?{nl}I didn't expect to hear that name again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003565	It is said that Lydia Schaffen defeated the Demon Lord Ziburynas a long time ago.{nl}And it is also said that she used an arrow called the Flechette, made by an ancestor of mine.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003566	I have yet to find it, but... I did my research on it.{nl}I found a way to produce an arrow that's almost as powerful as the original Flechette.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003567	This arrow should be powerful enough to defeat the Essence of Ziburynas in the Barynwell area.{nl}My apprentice should arrive soon and he will make the arrow for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003568	It's already been a few days since he left...{nl}If you go now, he should be there when you arrive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003569	The Master wanted me to have this?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003570	This is quite an impressive recipe indeed.{nl}I heard that a powerful demon named Pbeta was found in this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003571	I noticed there were some natural Obsidian on the way to 86 Waters.{nl}It seems to contain some magic...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003572	I will make preparations to melt the Obsidian while you're gone.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003573	Now I can make the arrow.{nl}I noticed that there were a lot of Humming Dukes in the area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003574	Humming Duke feathers are flexible but durable. They'll make for good fletching materials.{nl}Would you collect some for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003575	That's a lot of feathers.{nl}Some are bent, but the rest look good enough to use for the fletching.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003576	Please wait while I make the arrow.{nl}It's going to take some time... Oh, I remembered that someone was looking for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003577	Oh, it looks like Voleta is done with the arrows.{nl}You should go with Morvio and Voleta, then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003578	Let's go back to where we set the trap and look for traces!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003579	So the Essence of Ziburynas has been found in the Barynwell area.{nl}That's why you need to learn about Flechette, the arrow used to defeat Ziburynas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003580	Thanks to you, I've stored the Flechette safely.{nl}Since then, my research on the Flechette has progressed exponentially.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003581	Although it's not as powerful...{nl}I've managed to finally make a new arrow almost as powerful as the Flechette.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003582	I don't have any right now, but my apprentice left for Barynwell.{nl}I will give you the materials and the recipe for the arrows. Deliver them to my apprentice and he'll make the arrows for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003583	I know there are other people helping the resistance soldiers from the outside.{nl}My Master was apparently an acquaintance of Elder Ramunas' from the old days.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003584	After Ziburynas was defeated, Lydia Schaffen commanded the demon's essence to be kept in the Tower.{nl}That was because the Essence of Ziburynas was far too dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003585	We abandoned the Tower and formed the Resistance... But we're still outnumbered.{nl}If we could only get the neutral members to cross over to our side...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003586	I can't help but be amazed looking at the Fletcher Master's recipe.{nl}There is no doubt that this arrow will be the coup de grace for Pbeta.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003587	Please find and restore Lydia Schaffen's relic with Lehon.{nl}You will be able to find the clues in Rombas Hill Road.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003588	The story of how Lydia Schaffen defeated Ziburynas is a very famous one.{nl}It's how Ziburynas Forest–the place where the demon was defeated–got its name.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003589	We are short of supplies because of the enemy ambush.{nl}I'm worried because it's going to be some time until a new shipment comes in.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003590	There was a pledge I made on my pilgrimage to the Great Cathedral.{nl}I pledged that I would fight for justice as a member of the Schaffenstar.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003591	I slipped and hurt myself seriously on my pilgrimage to the Great Cathedral way back.{nl}This is nothing compared to that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180827_003592	Those who were once allies now have their arrows aimed at each other.{nl}It pains me to see this.

QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004472	If you're thinking of moving to Nicopolis, I would have to try and stop you.{nl}You're not safe here, not even within these city limits.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004473	A city of wizards sounds fascinating on paper, but, in reality, it isn't.{nl}All these objects moving about on their own make this place look haunted.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004474	It seems to be locked because of the devices found near it.{nl}Let's try turning them off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004475	Removing the crystal from the magic circle could unlock it. Ask Nidia for a way to remove the crystal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004476	No... There seems to be a problem with the Barrier Stones...{nl}Looks like we need to go check up on them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004477	As a magician, I was fascinated by how the starry stairs were made.{nl}I wanted to study the stairs closely but I was afraid that the magic that binds the stairs will clash with the kind of magic I've mastered.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004478	I wanted to ask someone to help me gather the material that makes up the starry stairs.{nl}But asking others of things I can't do myself would just be rude, wouldn't it?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004479	You've brought the materials that make up the starry stairs! Thank you.{nl}I'm so happy that I can finally study the starry stairs!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004480	I am the guard in charge of watching over Starry Town.{nl}Being on guard duty isn't easy what with all the monsters and strange devices lying about.

QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004483	If you can't seem to handle the monsters, just tell me.{nl}I'd rather that I work harder than to see you get hurt out there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004484	You're so powerful that I want to ask you to stay and help me guard the city.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004485	Ah... Yes, let's call you adventurer for now.{nl}It's best that you don't stay long in Feline Post Town.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004486	Those who caused the past incident at Nicopolis now roam the streets as monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004487	The Teal Specter is the worst of them all.{nl}He is now an evil spirit that possesses the townsfolk to suck the life force out of them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004488	Why don't we do anything about him, you ask?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004489	Owyn Dilben had tried to locate the Teal Specter himself, but because of the aftermath of the incident at Nicopolis and Medzio Diena it had become very difficult to track down a spirit in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004490	I want to investigate the people who arrived in Feline Post Town around the time of the incident.{nl}I'll need the Resident Logs for that. We will need the secretary's assistance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004491	I will let you borrow the Resident Logs if you need it for your investigation.{nl}You can give them back to me after you're done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004492	The night was so dark that I could not go out without a torch.{nl}It was when I was heading towards the Keista Intersection on my watch duty that I heard someone moaning.{nl}I headed over to where the sound was coming from and found a well-built man afloat in midair.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004493	I screamed out loud.{nl}Then someone who was hiding in the dark started running away towards the Raktas Intersection.{nl}I chased him thinking that he could be a suspect in the Feline Post Town Case.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004494	He was too fast so I couldn't keep up with him.{nl}I threw my torch at him in the hopes of stopping him but the fire from the torch just burnt his clothes slightly and I lost him at the Raktas Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004495	You can smell the chemicals on the clothes.{nl}Perhaps you'll find something if you investigate this smell further.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004496	We want to identify the chemical found on the clothing.{nl}In order for that, we need the Ingredy Powder found on Mimorats. Could you get some for us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004497	I have finished making the necessary preparations.{nl}Let's find out what this chemical really is.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004498	The chemicals found in the clothing are used in manufacturing dyes. {nl}The town's chemist is known to deal with such chemicals.{nl}He is our prime suspect for now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004499	I can feel that we're getting closer to finding the possessed.{nl}You will be able to find the chemist in Irodymai Trade District.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004500	{nl}I will go ahead and question him first.{nl}I am sure that the chemist will lead us one step closer to finding the possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004501	From the testimonial, I am sure that he is not possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004502	The chemist spoke of an artist and a woman named Kelly.{nl}The two of them could have the access to such chemicals.{nl}We should spray them both with the Detecting Solution and find out who is possessed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004503	What happened to the Teal Specter?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004504	We've finally vanquished the Teal Specter.{nl}Thanks to you, the Feline Post Town Case has finally been closed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004505	This is a Scroll of Gravity.{nl}Use this on the crystal and the crystal will float into the air.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004506	Use the Scroll of Gravity on the crystal to make the crystal float mid-air.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004507	The city is a site of the devastating accident caused by those that were blinded by their own glory and quest for knowledge beyond their comprehension.{nl}What we are looking at is more than just the remnants of a bygone era.{nl}The city itself is a site of learning.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004508	I want to study the city in order to learn what it has to teach.{nl}Through what I've learned, I want to guide the people and provide them better a future for the good of the entire Kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004509	These are the thoughts that run through my head when in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004510	Magic gives us convenience, but at times it is a force that can destroy us.{nl}At long last I've finally come to understand the weight of the responsibilities that I have as a wizard here in Nicopolis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004511	There are many unidentified magic structures around the city.{nl}Some of them are known to cause trouble so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004512	But is there enough time to leave everything to Skywa... And it would be difficult to protect.{nl}Would you be willing to help Skywa?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004513	Then, somehow their restrainment got weaker and we took the chance to escape.{nl}But as you can see, they are trying to take us again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004514	It's going to take some time for me to track Zsaia.{nl}But I believe I found the other Kupoles!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004515	Why can't you understand how I feel... Zsaia.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004516	Why is she so stubborn...{nl}I can't understand...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004517	Grisia is nothing but delusional.{nl}Does she really think we can escape from the demons?{nl}And you're a fool...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004518	This is our only hope.{nl}There's nothing we can do.{nl}So don't try to stop me!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004519	I can't trust a human.{nl}Get out of my way!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004520	I've already lost the goddess, I can't lose my sisters too...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004521	{nl}Oh, Goddess...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004522	Did she not hear my voice?{nl}She's going to end up like Zsaia, running away like this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004523	I think I've found Velad.{nl}She's at the West Sanctuary.{nl}I believe she's waiting for someone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004524	Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004525	So you're the one who was with Grisia.{nl}What are you up to? Hanging around a weak Kupole like her.{nl}Don't even think you can fool me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004526	Having a sister of mine disgraced like this grieves me beyond measure...{nl}But I want to save her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004527	{nl}Even if it isn't, there's nothing you can do to stop me.{nl}I'll talk to her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004528	{nl}I feel terribly guilty asking you to do such a sad thing.{nl}But please.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004529	There is a trap that shoots arrows, which is stopping our men from moving forward.{nl}I need your help to solve this problem, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004530	The scouts reported seeing demons in the Astral Tower that they've never seen before.{nl}They could be entering the tower through the portal on the first floor that Elder Ramunas has spoken of.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004531	According to the scouts, they spotted a red glow that looked like a portal in the Engine Room on 1F.{nl}Could you go and have a look for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004532	Elder Ramunas had mentioned that Ignas installed a portal somewhere on 1F.{nl}I remember that he said the portal lead to the Outer Wall District 13.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004533	We progressed this much while you were away investigating the portals. So the portals do exist...{nl}Now we know for sure that the demons are sending in their reinforcements through the portals.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004534	Elder Ramunas has provided us with the materials to make an explosive that could destroy the portal.{nl}But it will take some time for the explosive to be crafted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004535	Destroying the portal would be our best bet in stopping the demons invading the tower...{nl}But we need to buy time to manufacture the explosive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004536	The suppressors will make it difficult for demons to use the portals.{nl}Please install the Portal Suppressors around the portals.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004537	You've come. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.{nl}We've just completed the explosive.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004538	Now, you will have to set the explosive near the portals.{nl}When it explodes, the magic that powers the portals will disappear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004539	We may fail to destroy all portals if there is a powerful demon or magic guarding the portals.{nl}I will give you some more suppressors just in case such a thing happens.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004540	So it hasn't been removed completely.{nl}But it's okay. That should have drastically decreased the number of demons invading the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004541	I need you to help me with something while the Resistance soldiers fight the remaining demons near the portal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004542	From the reports, we have found that the Control Device for the arrow trap is in the Command Room on 1F.{nl}The reports also said that the road to the Command Room is a perilous one full of demons and more traps.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004543	Could you go check the Command Room on 1F?{nl}Please defeat the monsters in the area as well to make way for the Resistance soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004544	The Astral Tower had always been an impregnable fortress in stopping the demon invasion.{nl}But now to see them enter the tower so freely... I am worried.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004545	It could either be the demons or the Schaffenstar that installed the barrier.{nl}We are currently out of materials to make more explosives.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004546	I guess the only thing left to do is use the Magic Stones carried by the demons to destroy the barrier.{nl}The Elder once told me that the Magic Stones that demons carry have small traces of magic in them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004547	I'm sure we will be able to make a new explosive that could blow up the barrier using these Magic Stones.{nl}Could you collect the Magic Stones for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004548	I am sure that we will be able to make powerful explosives out of these Magic Stones.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004549	You did it! Could you hold on a second?{nl}I will make the explosives for you right away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004550	We, the Resistance, will defeat the demons on the way up to the next floor.{nl}But I must warn you that it's going to take some time for the explosives to go off because they were made using Magic Stones. The demons will try to stop you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004551	We will fight off the demons located on the way to the next floor up while you disarm the trap.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004552	Instead of 2F, we will take the path straight for 4F that the Elder has prepared for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004553	I will remain here to take care of the remaining demons and to make sure other Resistance members can make it safely to 4F.{nl}I have marked your map with the Supreme Commander's location.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004554	The security here in 4F has been tightened.{nl}The demons must know that 1F has fallen to the Resistance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004555	According to our scouts, the Defensive Device here is made up of two parts.{nl}I've been told there is a poison gas trap in the area, as well as arrows.{nl}You must be cautious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004556	We sent our men to scout the Second Control Room to have a closer look.{nl}Could you have a look at the First Control Room for us?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004557	You've returned. Our scouts have also returned from the Second Control Room.{nl}Let's discuss our next plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004558	Hmm... But now I realize that there is no way that the demons will let their guard down this easy.{nl}There must be something that we're overlooking.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004559	Ignas is cunning, cold-hearted, and cautious.{nl}From what we've gathered, we can tell that disarming the trap in the Second Control Room won't be an easy task.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004560	We will march onwards regardless of all the tricks Ignas has up his sleeves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004561	I thought he was acting rather suspicious so I shot him with an arrow that nullifies all magic effects and he collapsed to the ground.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004562	First the arrows and now the poison gas...{nl}My heart hangs heavy seeing my comrades fall as we march onwards.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004563	Thanks to you, now I can cure the poisoned soldiers. Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004564	I know it's suspicious, but we can't help but agree to his terms as we have no other choice.{nl}Revelator. Do not hesitate to back away when you find something suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004565	Adaux has deployed demons towards the Control Room to trick Ignas into thinking he's still working for him.{nl}Defeat the guardian at the Control Room to retrieve the lever and use it to shut down the Defensive Device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004566	We want to move as quickly as possible since the arrows have stopped{nl}but our soldiers can't seem to move any further because of this evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004567	Adaux said that he had a favor for you since you are free from the influence of the nefarious energy.{nl}He says that there is an invisible barrier that Ignas created on 12F.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004568	The invisible barrier must be removed at all costs if we want to get past 12F.{nl}Though we would still have to do something about the nefarious energy after the barrier's been removed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004569	We've investigated the area beforehand but did not find any device that seemed to control the barrier.{nl}Perhaps there are areas that we have not searched yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004570	We cannot back down now, Revelator.{nl}We must find a way to remove the invisible barrier and the nefarious energy by any means necessary.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004571	This relic will help you in your time of need.{nl}The power of the relic has been freed by your own hands and restored to the Girl.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004572	Return to the invisible barrier that blocks your path, Savior.{nl}The mysterious girl is waiting for you there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004573	Return to the invisible barrier that blocks your path.{nl}The mysterious girl is waiting for you there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004574	I've told Byle what needs to be done in the upper floors before you arrived.{nl}You should talk to him for further instructions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004575	With Henika and Adaux gone, only Cezaris remains by Ignas' side. He should be feeling pretty anxious about now.{nl}First, I will tell you what needs to be done here based on what I've learned from Adaux.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004576	I'm relieved that our men seem relatively unharmed despite the ambush.{nl}Now I know for sure that Ignas is at his wit's end. This is our chance to strike!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004577	He said that each device is controlled in a different method.{nl}First, go to the Schaffenstar Lodges 1 and 2. Defeat the monsters there and disable the devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004578	First, disable the protective devices in Schaffenstar Lodges 1 and 2.{nl}The demons there will try to stop you so clear the area before you disable the device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004579	Go to Schaffenstar Lodge 3 and obtain Suspicious Scrolls by defeating the demons there.{nl}Use the scrolls to look for a magic source in the area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004580	When you locate the magic source, destroy it and the barrier surrounding the Protective Device will weaken.{nl}That's when you will have to disable the Protective Device there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004581	In Schaffenstar Lodge 4, there are demons that act as a power source for the barriers for the Protective Device.{nl}Defeat the demons to weaken the barrier and disable the device there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004582	To see Ignas before my own eyes... It's almost over.{nl}What Adaux said was true. Some of the demons we fought were actually our comrades...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004583	But there's no time to look back now.{nl}We must end this once and for all and take back the Astral Tower for the sake of all of our fallen comrades.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004584	For security, it is said that one key must be found first to find the second key.{nl}Let's look for the first key in the area closest to us and talk about the second key then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004585	If there is a demon that reacts to the first key you've found, it's most likely the that the demon is holding the second key.{nl}Come back after you've found both keys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004586	Now we must face Cezaris. According to Adaux, Cezaris has turned himself into a demon completely.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004587	It's weaker than the arrow that subdued Henika, but you will still be able to use these on Cezaris to weaken him temporarily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004588	We will deal with Ignas after we've taken care of Cezaris.{nl}The Resistance will clear the way to the Elder Chambers for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004589	Hopefully it won't come down to that,{nl}but think of this as a backup plan just in case something goes wrong.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004590	You've defeated Ignas!{nl}The Resistance has finally reclaimed the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004591	The Resistance is now complete.{nl}The Schaffenstar and the Astral Tower are now free from the tyranny of evil.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004592	You've found the levers. Go to the second control room.{nl}I will join the other members and we will meet you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004593	I would like to ask you for a special favor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004594	They should have reported back by now, but there are no signs of them.{nl}Would you find out what happened to them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004595	I followed you here just to make sure...{nl}That was close!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004596	Do you want something?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004597	Did you defeat the Hydra?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004598	The moss growing around the lake makes it difficult for us soldiers to move around.{nl}The ground is too slippery, some of us even got hurt because of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004599	Unfortunately there's no way to do it other than getting it out by hand.{nl}My job used to be clearing out the weeds, so I'm used to it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004600	Getting the Water Facility working, defeating the Hydra...{nl}It can't have been easy. You're quite impressive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004601	Would you help dismantle and remove the traps?
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004602	Here's what you can say; listen carefully.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004603	Did you spray the poison on the supplies?{nl}It won't kill them, but it'll stop them for a while. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004604	There's dark smoke coming out of the assembly area.{nl}Something must have happened...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004605	This means Lydia Schaffen's provisions were all a plan of Goddess Laima...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004606	The members siding with Ignas now will certainly change their minds if they find out.{nl}Imagine finding out the leaders of your camp were demons all along.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004607	I have yet to find it, but... I did my research on it.{nl}I found a way to produce an arrow that's almost as powerful as the original Flechette.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004608	This arrow should be powerful enough to defeat the Essence of Ziburynas in the Barynwell area.{nl}My apprentice should arrive soon and he will make the arrow for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004609	But it looks like we're going to have to face Pbeta now. Is that right?{nl}Won't we have to deal with his subordinates as well? I think we should prepare for that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004610	As you know, the resistance needs soldiers to fight for them, but most of all they need the funds to support themselves.{nl}My guess is that a lot of people are helping with donations.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004611	Now that the water point is working, the demons will have to leave the lake.{nl}Of course, it will be a while before all the water is purified...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004612	This is a conflict zone between Ignas' army and the resistance.{nl}Please refrain from any unnecessary movements.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004613	We sent a few scouts to the Lanko Waters region... no news from them yet.{nl}They should be back by now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004614	Somewhere in this region is Pbeta, the demon Ignas is siding with.{nl}I still can't understand why he would do such a thing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004615	What you did was remarkable.{nl}I say your talent is impressive, even for a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004616	Owyn Dilben found that part of Nicopolis disappeared to the Other Dimension at the time of the accident.{nl}Now I'm in charge of investigating the disappeared region.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004617	Unfortunately, my other work here has kept me from doing much investigation at all.{nl}I was hoping to find someone talented enough to help me with this task.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004618	If it isn't too much to ask, would you help me investigate the Magic Research Facility?{nl}A Revelator of your caliber is more than qualified for a task like this, I'm sure.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004619	I've heard that the Magic Research Facility is highly populated with monsters.{nl}It's uncharted territory after all, and therefore very dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004620	Not only that, there's a high chance you'll encounter monsters with very powerful mana.{nl}If you do, you must promise to defeat them.{nl}If any such monsters cross over to our dimension, the consequences will be catastrophic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004621	Remember, the Magic Research Facility is a dangerous place. Make sure to move in a group.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004622	If what you say is true, the Magic Research Facility is even more dangerous than I thought.{nl}I need to be careful with who I let in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004623	But first, I'm going to report your findings to Owyn Dilben.{nl}Thank you very much for all your help!
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004624	Audrone
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004625	You're no ordinary traveler, are you? Wandering around here like that.{nl}My name is Audrone, I'm a guard here at Feline Post Town.{nl}Mr. Dupin asked me to do a bit of investigation in the area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004626	Have you heard of a place called Nicopolis?{nl}It was a city created by wizards of the past.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004627	The wizards of Nicopolis conducted quite a lot of research in their time.{nl}One of their leaders, the Quipmage, is thought to have attempted merging different creatures.{nl}The records show that he captured large numbers of monsters and animals for his experiments.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004628	We also know that the great accident of Nicopolis influenced those experiments in many ways.{nl}We believe that is what led to the creation of a powerful monster known as the Asiomage.{nl}But to this day, we haven't found either him or the Quipmage.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004629	Mr. Dupin visited Feline Post Town not long ago to gather more information.{nl}It was his hypothesis that the Quipmage had once built a research facility of his own.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004630	He asked me to investigate the area in case there were traces of the Quipmage or the Asiomage around.{nl}After some time, we found his testing grounds and confirmed that the Asiomage described in his records is still alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004631	The monster we saw was taken by anger and resentment.{nl}From what we gathered at the site, he seems to be making plans to do something with the research facility.{nl}That's only our guess, but there's no doubt that the Asiomage has the ability to hurt many innocent people if he ever escapes from the testing grounds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004632	I understand this is a lot to ask, but would you help us defeat the Asiomage?{nl}The other guards are already on their way to report our findings to Mr. Dupin, but we may not have much time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004633	Thank you! Your help will be most important.{nl}Just remember, the Asiomage is angered and dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004634	Come back to me when you are ready.{nl}The entrance to the testing grounds is hidden by a barrier, so you will not be able to see it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004635	We can create a gap in the barrier using a scroll Mr. Dupin gave me, but it won't last for long.{nl}In any case, I will be here guarding the entrance if you need me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004636	The Asiomage remembers being subjected to the Quipmage's experiments, that is why he is angry and out for revenge.{nl}If he ever escapes from the testing grounds, the lives of innocent people will be in danger.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004637	You defeated the Asiomage! Thank you.{nl}Now there will be no more memories of the Quipmage's cruel experiments...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004638	And yet, the fact that he was planning to harm people out of vengeance is alarming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004639	I should look around a little longer and report back to Mr. Dupin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20181017_004640	This is where the Quipmage, one of Nicopolis' old leaders, built his research testing grounds.{nl}On these grounds lives a powerful monster called the Asiomage.

QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004711	{nl}Okay, shall we go set up the mark, then?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004712	Let's go down to the entrance of the reservoir regions first.{nl}If there are no monsters there, crossing the area should be relatively easy.{nl}But we should check first, just in case.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004713	{nl}I was hoping you could help me there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004714	Alright, the mark's down. Let's move to the next region.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004715	Next up is Outer Wall District 9.{nl}Meet me there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004716	Can you believe the Capital was just behind these walls?{nl}Not that long ago this place was full of merchants and adventurers...{nl}Their lives filling up the city day and night.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004717	{nl}Where are the goddesses?{nl}Could They really be gone?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004718	But then, doesn't that mean the goddesses put the fate of the entire world in the hands of a single person?{nl}I know I wouldn't leave it at that if I were a goddess...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004719	{nl}When you lost everything, didn't you pray for the goddesses to save you?{nl}When you met Them, what did They say to you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004720	Sorry if I'm getting a little agitated...{nl}Let's just focus on our task.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004721	Outer Wall Districts 9 and 11 are interconnected.{nl}The people there are acting like they're being hypnotized by something.{nl}I try to scare a few of them, but they just ran away.{nl}If you're going to travel there, you need to prepare yourself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004722	{nl}First, let's focus on setting up that mark.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004723	We're going to need some Magnetic Dirt to make the mark.{nl}I buried some around here, so we should be able to it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004724	One of us has to search for it, so let me cover for you.{nl}If you find any magnetic dirt just dig it out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004725	This should be enough to make the mark last a few days.{nl}I'll go set it up and move on to the next region right away.{nl}Meet me at Pystis Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004726	Come on.{nl}After we set up this last mark I'm gonna be almost done with my part.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004727	{nl}Some time ago when I was investigating the Heretics, I found out that the demons passed through here.{nl}I asked the locals to help with my investigation but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004728	{nl}All they did was fight over the land...{nl}I think the demons might be up to something back at their base.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004729	{nl}We should investigate ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004730	There's enough traces around to see that something's not right. Why isn't anyone saying anything?{nl}Something's definitely happening in Pystis Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004731	I'm pretty sure the demons are up to something.{nl}Let's get the mark set up first, I'll keep an eye on things later.{nl}We need to have mark set up for that.{nl}Let me know when you're ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004732	Good.{nl}Let's set up the last mark.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004733	If the place is clear we should be able to set up the mark easily.{nl}But if there are monsters, we going to need to hide the mark from them...{nl}We'll need some time to prepare.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004734	{nl}Don't worry.{nl}I'll come back to help you after I set it up.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004735	I know I'd certainly show up and help us out right now if I were a goddess...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004736	The mark is hidden now, let's go back.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004737	There's still a lot to prepare before going back to Fedimian.{nl}I hope you don't forget our marks and all the things I told you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190412_004738	There's still a lot for you to do, I know...{nl}But I'll be here to help you out.

QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004779	It's too late for me, I'm injured. You need to save yourself!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004780	Thank you for saving me. I can't believe you took down all those monsters... Who are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004781	Oh, you're the Revelator. It's an honor to meet you.{nl}I'm part of the Recovery Squad that's trying to take Barynwell 27 Waters back from the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004782	I was attacked by the monsters during a recon mission.{nl}I thought I was done for until you appeared. Thank you for saving me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004783	Agh... The poison is spreading from my wound, I can't move.{nl}Fortunately the water of the lake helps to reduce the monsters' powers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004784	The parts near the water lilies have a special purifying effect.{nl}If that's okay, would you bring me some lake water from the Old Residential Quarters?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004785	Thank you, Revelator! You can put it inside this bottle.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004786	Go down to the Old Residential Quarters to get some lake water.{nl}The Water Facilities aren't as strong as they were before Medzio Diena, but the water should still have some of the effects.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004787	You're back so soon? Well, you're the Revelator after all.{nl}Thank you. I'll try and get my wound cured before the poison spreads any more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004788	I used the lake water on my wound, but I still can't move properly.{nl}Will you take this badge and report to my colleagues at the Recovery Squad camp?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004789	Thank you, Revelator! The camp is at the end of the road, up from where we are right now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004790	I should be safe for a while, now that you took down all the monsters.{nl}The camp is at the end of the road, up from where we are right now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004791	Recovery Squad Adjutant
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004792	We'll be sending a rescue team right away.{nl}Come to think of it, I never really introduced myself. I'm the Adjutant of the Recovery Squad here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004793	I'm so sorry to bother you on your first visit to the camp, but we're in a desperate situation.{nl}Would you care to listen?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004794	Thank you. I may wear the Schaffenstar uniform, but I am not a member.{nl}I was, once, but I abandoned the Tower with my mentor, who failed to become an Elder at the organization.{nl}My mentor couldn't give up his dream of becoming a Schaffenstar Elder, and he tried desperately to make his name known.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004795	One day, he gathered all of his apprentices and he told us.{nl}He said the Astral Tower, our home, was being attacked by demons... and we needed to get it back.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004796	We had already abandoned the Tower, but we couldn't just stand idly by and watch the demons take over it.{nl}After we arrived in 27 Waters, he told us Lydia Schaffen's lost relic was near.{nl}He said finding the relic would help us defeat the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004797	We started to look for the relic and take down the monsters.{nl}Every day we would fight and search, fight and search.{nl}Even when we were injured, the thought of finding the relic and taking back our home kept us going.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004798	Finally, we found a spot where we thought the relic might be hiding.{nl}Before we could do anything, a giant red portal appeared and demons started pouring from it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004799	Many of us never made it. Myself and a few others were barely holding on to our lives.{nl}We realized it would be impossible for us to take back the Tower on our own with all those monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004800	But our mentor still believed we had a chance, if only we could find the relic.{nl}He commanded us to carry on with the searches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004801	Since then, I started to suspect he had wanted us to take over Barynwell to find Schaffen's relic.{nl}I told him multiple times that it was reckless to do anything with the few men we had left.{nl}His answer is always the same: "Aren't you ashamed for the comrades who died for our mission?"
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004802	I do want to defeat the demons and take back our home, and avenge the ones who sacrificed themselves for the cause.{nl}It's just... we can't do it on our own.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004803	I know that finding Lydia Schaffen's relic and taking back the Tower is a good, honest cause.{nl}But in our current situation, there's little we can do, realistically.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004804	My colleagues and I managed to convince our mentor to stop the searches and look for the keepsakes of our fallen comrades instead.{nl}Once we have them, we're going to reorganize and ask our old allies for help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004805	If you were to help us look for the keepsakes, we could make good progress.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004806	I need to call the others first, they're doing a search in Barynwell Hill Road.{nl}Just hold on a minute.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004807	I'm very glad to have a Revelator on our side. That means the goddesses haven't forgotten us yet.{nl}Go up until you reach Barynwell Hill Road.{nl}I'll be preparing us some supplies in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004808	My colleagues are searching Barynwell Hill Road.{nl}There'll be monsters there, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004809	You're back. I told my colleague to go call our mentor, but no news of them yet.{nl}I guess I'll start by talking to the ones that just arrived.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004810	They aren't happy with the plan, are they? I understand...{nl}Our mentor always takes us to safe spots for the searches, after we take care of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004811	Even when the demon portal appeared... I'm sorry. I'm talking too much.{nl}I'll tell you next time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004812	After the portal appeared in the Collapsed Square, the area has been teeming with monsters.{nl}There's no way we can take it back all by ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004813	I think we need to reduce their numbers before we try to destroy the portal.{nl}The plan is to set up a trap and lure the monsters away. Will you help us install the trap? 
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004814	We can't receive external help, so our resources are scarce. This is our last chance to do anything.{nl}Let's make sure we succeed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004815	Go ahead and set up the bombs near the alleyway to the Collapsed Square.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004816	I'm glad we got the bomb setup out of the way.{nl}Now we just need to lure the monsters in.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004817	I was keeping an eye on the monsters while you set up the bombs.{nl}Can you wait by the marked spot near the alleyway?{nl}Let me know when you're ready so I can lure in the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004818	Are you ready? Okay, I'll lure the monsters in now.{nl}Go to the location and wait there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004819	Looking at the portal reminds me of all the comrades we lost.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004820	The operation was risky, we were ready for the worst. Luckily with you here, everything worked out better than expected.{nl}Thank you for doing right by our comrades.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004821	We need to destroy the portal before any more monsters can come through.{nl}But I think the explosion earlier may have attracted monsters from other areas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004822	We'll get ready to block the alleyways.{nl}You go and take down the portal at the Collapsed Square!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004823	The portal is in the middle of the Collapsed Square.{nl}Be careful, there could be monsters in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004824	Great job taking down the portal. We can finally look for our comrades' keepsakes.{nl}Also... our mentor is back and he wants to talk to you in private.{nl}I'll be setting up things so we can start searching the Old Concert Hall area in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004825	Recovery Squad Leader
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004826	Ah. Welcome, Revelator. I heard news of you arriving during my search. As you know, we're looking for the relic that will let us take over the Barynwell areas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004827	My students told me you helped them take down the demons. We are very grateful.{nl}As their mentor, I apologize for letting them pull you into all this trouble.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004828	That said, if you do agree to help us, finding the relic will only be a matter of time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004829	Only then, of course, will we be able to finally take back our land.{nl}We couldn't possibly face off that many monsters with such low numbers otherwise. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004830	I know my students must have complained to you about what's been happening.{nl}But now that the portal is destroyed, we can finally search the Old Concert Hall.{nl}That's the only area we haven't searched yet. I'm certain that the relic will be there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004831	I gave out orders to begin the search there already. Please, have some rest before you join us. I understand you just went through a difficult battle.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004832	I know my students must have complained to you about me.{nl}Too many of us died when that portal appeared and the monsters attacked.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004833	After that day, I knew the rest of us wouldn't survive if we were to face the monsters again.{nl}Our only chance to take back the Barynwell regions was to find Schaffen's relic once and for all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004834	Why didn't we receive external aid, you mean?{nl}Hmm... We did try to request it, but to no avail...{nl}After Medzio Diena, people can barely look after themselves, let alone help a group of strangers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004835	My students must be starting the search at the Old Concert Hall soon.{nl}Go ahead and join them there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004836	You're back. We managed to find our colleagues' keepsakes in the meantime. Thank you for the help, really.{nl}We also found a hidden location in the Old Concert Hall.{nl}Let me show you what was inside. This is...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004837	Hm? Do you feel that shaking? What's happening?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004838	That was a nasty monster... I don't know what we would've done without you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004839	You know, after Medzio Diena I often thought this was it, this is the end.{nl}But seeing you now, it gives me hope for the future.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004840	Brockal Himil
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004841	It's rare seeing someone make it here without a scratch. Are you perhaps a Revelator?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004842	What an honor to finally meet one of the Revelators.{nl}My name is Brockal Himil. I was sent from the Himil family to help take back the Maven areas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004843	Sorry if I'm being too brazen, but I could really use the help of someone like you.{nl}Would you care to give us a hand?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004844	Our local defense systems are damaged because of a monster attack we had.{nl}Before I explain, let me get out the orders to start repairing the stockades.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004845	Thank you. I'm glad you are as kind as you are talented.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004846	It's an honor to have you on our side.{nl}The damaged stockades are at the camp alleyway.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004847	We wouldn't have gotten our defense back up so quickly without you. Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004848	It's been a long time since family, the Himils, abandoned the Astral Tower.{nl}Yet, we couldn't stay still and watch it being taken over by the monsters. We needed to act.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004849	This region here connects to District 13 of the Outer Wall.{nl}If we can't block the monsters here, many people will be in danger.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004850	Maven 31 Waters, on the other hand, connects to the Outer Wall as well as two Water regions.{nl}Even if we take down all the monsters in one area, it won't be easy to cover all the regions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004851	I do think it will be long before our defense operation here is over.{nl}We're still receiving external aid, but we needed to find local resources as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004852	Fortunately, we now know that the nearest reservoir is not contaminated.{nl}I'm going to send out a few of our soldiers to secure food supplies, would you mind waiting?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004853	Are you sure? That's... very kind of you, thank you. To tell you the truth, many of our soldiers were injured in the last battle.{nl}I'm glad you're here to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004854	The reservoir is to the right.{nl}There are still monsters around, but the lake water is clean... It seems the Water Facilities there are still working.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004855	You're done already? Well, you really can't beat experience, can you?{nl}I'm honestly impressed, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004856	Our scouts found some suspicious monster movement in the Old Training Grounds near the camp.{nl}I don't know if we can stand another attack, if that's what they're planning.{nl}This time we need to hit them first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004857	Let's go take down the monsters at the Old Training Grounds!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004858	With you on our side, I'm sure victory will be ours.{nl}But of course, anything can happen in a battle.{nl}I'll make sure my soldiers are aware of that and don't lose their focus.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004859	Thank you for your service. The last battle was hard on us, many were injured during the conflict.{nl}This time you truly gave us the upper hand.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004860	Before you arrived, we had other confrontations with the monsters. Each one left several of our soldiers injured.{nl}The problem is that they keep coming, while our forces grow weaker and weaker.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004861	The soldiers' morale is lower than ever.{nl}Do you think you can help lift their spirits a little?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004862	I believe a hero like yourself can be a great influence on our forces.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004863	The atmosphere is completely different with you here, I can already feel it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004864	Another reason we weren't doing so well is the new monster that has arrived recently.{nl}Not only is it strong, it's also very clever. We don't know what to do about it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004865	I was going to put together a squad to take it down, but we're short on manpower. Right now we have a single student keeping an eye on the monsters at the Collapsed Shelter.{nl}Would you care to help him?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004866	Thank you, Revelator. I sent him a carrier pigeon earlier, so he should know you're coming.{nl}To get to the Collapsed Shelter, just go up this way and take a left before you reach the entrance to the Observatory.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004867	We'll be repairing our damaged equipment in the meantime.{nl}We can get ready to attack as soon as we're done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004868	Brockal Himil's Apprentice
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004869	Revelator! Hello! I'm a student of Mr. Brockal Himil, the one who's investigating the monsters.{nl}Mr. Himil told me you helped our forces back at the camp.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004870	My student is still learning, but he's a fine warrior.{nl}Still, as his mentor, I'm worried about him being on his own.{nl}He's at the Collapsed Shelter investigating the new monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004871	When we first arrived, the monsters looked like they were just acting by instinct.{nl}With a little strategy we were able to overpower them, even despite their large numbers.{nl}Recently, however, they've started to make formations and ambush our forces.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004872	We've found that, ever since this new monster appeared, it seems to be commanding the others.{nl}That's why I came out to observe their behavior.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004873	These monsters started acting very differently after the "leaders" arrived.{nl}They're no longer territorial, and instead have started to form their own social groups.{nl}That's how they make up for each other's weaknesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004874	Now they'll hide in the water plants and ambush our soldiers, or they'll wait for night time to attack.{nl}They're getting more and more dangerous, which is why our mentor tried to take down the leader.{nl}What we didn't know was that this leader is a lot more powerful than the other monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004875	Not only that, the leader is always surrounded by other monsters.{nl}If we're going to take it down, first we need to get rid of the minions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004876	We know it's a dangerous task, but you're the only one we can count on.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004877	Thank you, Revelator!{nl}You can take care of the monsters at Maven Intersection while I look out for the leader.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004878	Mr. Himil was injured in the last battle while he was trying to protect me.{nl}He never complained, he simply kept going until the end.{nl}Having a mentor like this really makes me want to work hard to defeat these monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004879	I never knew you were so strong.{nl}With you around, we're that much closer to finally getting rid of all evil energy in the region.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004880	Unfortunately there are a lot more monsters around now.{nl}If you're going to fight the leader, you need to preserve your power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004881	We believe there's a device located around the Maven lake area that can fight off the monsters.{nl}But ever since we arrived, we've had our hands so full with all these monsters that we haven't been able to check.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004882	We think this device could be very useful to us, but it's hard to tell how long that would take.{nl}So, for now, we're going to use a set of bombs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004883	Thank you, Revelator. I'll go and set up some bombs at Maven Intersection.{nl}You can do the same around the Collapsed Observatory.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004884	I'm going to install the bombs and keep an eye on the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004885	The bombs are all set. Time to lure in the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004886	I'm going to lure in the remaining monsters.{nl}You can wait by the Collapsed Observatory and take down any monsters that survive the explosion.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004887	After we get rid of these monsters, we need to report back to our mentor and get ready to fight the leader.{nl}I really hope we make it this time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004888	The leader appeared all of a sudden when I was luring in the monsters.{nl}I managed to defend myself from the attack, but I think my arm is broken.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004889	I probably would be even worse off if it weren't for you.{nl}That monster's clever, it must have figured out what I was up to.{nl}It don't think it saw you, at least.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004890	I can't believe you took down that monster before I could even send out a carrier pigeon...{nl}You really are something special. I admire you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004891	That was close, I'm glad you were around to help me. Let's report back to Mr. Himil.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004892	Revelator! We heard a monster, I was just about to gather our forces. What on earth just happened?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004893	I have never seen anyone take down such a powerful monster, you really are something else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004894	I'm still amazed that you took down the leader on your own.{nl}And thank you for saving my student. We're really fortunate to have you here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004895	That lead monster was our biggest obstacle so far.{nl}I never thought we would take it down without some serious sacrifice.{nl}I can't believe you did it so easily...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004896	Now it's only a matter of time until we get rid of the other monsters.{nl}I wish we could hold on to you a little longer, but I know you'll be needed somewhere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004897	I know the Lakers that took care of these regions are having an especially hard time right now.{nl}I don't think they were trained in combat yet.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004898	If you ever meet the Lakers, do help them out like you did to us.{nl}I'll pray that your journey will always be blessed by the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004899	{nl}From now on, I swear to protect this region with my own life.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004900	Garrison
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004901	Thank you. I was so nervous, I'm glad you were here to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004902	Thank you, Revelator! I'll protect this lake with my own life.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004903	I was so afraid all this time... But no more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004904	I know we're going to win this battle with you.{nl}I'm never going to give up. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004905	Laker Boy
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004906	Hi there. Are you a traveler?{nl}Be careful around here, this place has been full of monsters and water plants since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004907	A Revelator... oh, you're the Revelator! I guess I was worried for nothing, then.{nl}I heard that you help people you are in trouble... Can you help me too?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004908	Oh, thank you! Ever since Medzio Diena, the water plants around here have been growing bigger and faster.{nl}It's been getting harder and harder for me to take care of the lake.{nl}Would you help me get rid of the water plants around the watch post?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004909	Anyone who wants to become a Schaffenstar has to clean out the water plants.{nl}I'm gonna work hard at the lake, and hopefully one day I'll go live in the Astral Tower.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004910	Wow, you're great at getting rid of those heavy water plants! I can't even pick them up.{nl}If I become a member of the Schaffenstar, will I be strong like you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004911	To process the water plants, we need to use the machine inside the water point control room.{nl}Usually we hide it away so the monsters don't find it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004912	I'm gonna go first and get the machine ready.{nl}Meanwhile, can you move the water plants we got from the lake?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004913	You don't have to move all of them! Just take some and I'll do the rest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004914	You moved all of them? Wow, that was enough work for half a day... Thank you.{nl}Now let me show you how to process the plants with the machine.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004915	Um, Revelator... We have a problem. I never tried to process this many plants...{nl}I don't think my magic source is gonna be enough.{nl}I'm gonna get some more magic sources. You just wait here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004916	What? You wanna help? But you already helped me move the plants... Thank you!{nl}You can find some magic sources at the Old Warehouse. They're like shiny stones, you'll see them right away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004917	You're so friendly, Revelator.{nl}I wanna be a nice member of the Schaffenstar and help other people like you do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004918	Wow, that's a lot of magic sources!{nl}I'm not gonna have to worry about them for a while now.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004919	You helped go through so many water plants, thank you!{nl}If that's okay, will you help our leader at the Laker Temporary Base too?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004920	She's the only one who can fight in the whole area of Maven 32 Waters...{nl}She's having a hard time right now because of all the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004921	I wish I could help her fight off the monsters too... but I don't know how.{nl}I bet you could help her do that, though!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004922	Laker Leader
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004923	Welcome. I'm the Laker Leader in charge of this region.{nl}Before I say anything else, I believe I owe you an apology.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004924	You see, I've been watching you ever since you arrived in the area. I had to know who you were.{nl}I was ready to attack you if I saw anything that looked suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004925	But you were different from what I expected. I saw how you helped the boy.{nl}Thank you for that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004926	The leader is always watching over this area.{nl}One time she saved me and my sister when a monster appeared.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004927	When I grow up, I wanna be a member of the Schaffenstar and help the Laker Leader!{nl}I think she's at the Laker Temporary Base right now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004928	But I wonder... not many people manage to get through all the monsters out there...{nl}You don't look like an ordinary traveler... so what are you doing here, exactly?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004929	I see. You're a Revelator. I'm sorry for being so suspicious.{nl}Most of us Lakers come from villages around the lake.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004930	Our people have been taking care of this lake for more than 600 years, ever since Lydia Schaffen founded the Astral Tower.{nl}I, too, grew up taking care of the water plants, dreaming of one day joining the Schaffenstar.{nl}That is, until that tragic day that changed everything.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004931	After Medzio Diena, the plants started to grow bigger and bigger.{nl}But we never gave up. We carried on taking care of the lake, and we managed to keep the plants under control.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004932	So... we can handle the plants now, but the monsters are another story.{nl}I learned how to fight from a mentor who's no longer with us.{nl}But most of the Lakers were never trained in combat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004933	We're seeing more and more monsters around, to the point where it's hard for us to handle them.{nl}There's also a giant monster that's encroaching on our working areas. We can barely get to the water plants anymore.{nl}Will you please help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004934	Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004935	I've tried several times to take down the giant monster myself, but there's little I can do on my own.{nl}The most I could do was feed it some bait with tranquilizers to knock it down for a while.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004936	Before you arrived, I was crafting some poison arrows to use on the monster.{nl}Can I ask you to get me some Plants with Lake Energy from the Old Stakeout Box?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004937	I'll be collecting the other materials and keeping an eye on the monster meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004938	I learned how to make poison from my mentor. They're a famous hunter, you see.{nl}They had to leave because of something, but they should be back someday.{nl}And be careful, the Old Stakeout Box is still full of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004939	Great. I hope the monsters didn't give you too hard of a time out there.{nl}The giant one is still knocked out from the spiked bait. We should get going before it wakes up.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004940	Fighting this giant monster is going to attract other monsters in the area.{nl}Worst case scenario, these monsters can make the whole situation turn against us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004941	The giant monster is asleep in the alleyway to the Old Laker Training Grounds.{nl}Would you clear out the monsters there while I finish the poison arrows?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004942	My mentor taught me to always hunt with caution.{nl}It's important to get rid of any uncertainties.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004943	Please get rid of a few monsters around the area.{nl}I'll go and help you as soon as I'm done with these arrows.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004944	That was fast. I've just finished the poison, too.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004945	Time to take care of that giant monster. Sigh... I'm a little nervous.{nl}I'll be counting on you for this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004946	I know you got rid of the monsters in the area, but you never know when the ones from other regions are going to come running.{nl}We should get going now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004947	I'll head to the Old Laker Training Grounds first and keep an eye on the giant.{nl}Just come over to the alleyway when you're ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004948	Glad to see you're safe, Revelator. I'm sorry I couldn't help.{nl}I don't know what would happen to me if you weren't around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004949	I thought my training was done after my mentor left, but I guess not.{nl}Thank you so much for your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004950	Uhh... this wound's more serious than I thought. I need to have it checked back at the camp.{nl}I'm really sorry, Revelator, but there's one more favor I want to ask of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004951	The giant monster may be gone now, but our problems at the lake are far from over.{nl}Young lakers like the Laker Boy need self-defense weapons, but to make them we need a material that can only be obtained from monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004952	I would hunt the monsters myself, but in this state, there isn't much I can do.{nl}Would you hunt down the Frocoli at the Laker Shelter and get the materials for me instead?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004953	The material we need comes from the Frocoli monsters that live in the Laker Shelter.{nl}I know you must be tired from the battle with the giant monster, I'm very sorry.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004954	You got the materials. Great.{nl}This should keep us safe for a while. But of course,  we'll need to be on the lookout for any new threats.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004955	Thank you for all your good work here.{nl}I know we can't always depend on the help of people like you.{nl}This is our land, and we need to be strong enough to defend it ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004956	I hope we'll finally become strong enough to defend our land by the next time you see us.{nl}May your journey always be blessed by the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004957	I know we received a lot of help from you, but it was an honor to fight by your side, Revelator.{nl}I wonder if this is how the old Lakers felt when they helped Lydia Schaffen protect the Astral Tower.{nl}I hope we can be of help to you next time you see us. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004958	When I become a member of the Schaffenstar, I'm gonna be like you and the Laker Leader and help people who need me!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004959	The Outer Wall was the area most affected by Medzio Diena.{nl}If the monsters start crossing over into the region... Well, we can't let that happen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004960	We're fighting these monsters every day.{nl}But no matter how many we take down, their numbers stay the same. It's honestly making me lose hope.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004961	The monsters are multiplying as we speak.{nl}What's going to be of us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004962	The borders are safe for now, but the monsters have been acting strange recently.{nl}I really don't know what to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004963	After we take back the Maven region, I'm going to go back and propose to my best friend.{nl}Do you think we'll be alright after this?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004964	The monsters could still try another attack here.{nl}It's best if we go back to the camp.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004965	We'll... take care of the body.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004966	I did have my qualms about Mr. Himil, but deep down I really trusted him.{nl}When he first stepped up as our leader, he was a really honorable man. I don't know what made him change like that...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004967	Also, the object we found wasn't Lydia Schaffen's relic.{nl}We're not sure what it is, but it seems to be an important part of the Water Facility.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004968	It didn't break even after that giant monster stepped on it, which makes us think it's a very special object.{nl}It may not be the relic, but we believe we can use it to reinforce the area's defensive system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004969	First, our forces need some time to reorganize. We're exhausted, both mentally and physically.{nl}We'll prepare for battle later.{nl}We still need to find out where and how to use the piece, so I might need to contact some former colleagues...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004970	Come to think of it, Mr. Himil did act a little strange.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004971	After the portal appeared in the Collapsed Square, we were looking to escape to the Maven 31 Waters region.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004972	But if that region was already taken over by monsters, we would end up completely stranded.{nl}I suggested that we investigate the Barynwell Lot and Maven 31 Waters in advance to make sure.{nl}Mr. Himil, however, insisted that he take charge of the Barynwell Lot himself. He wouldn't even let us go near it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004973	He said he had already investigated the area and drawn out an escape route, that it would be a waste of time for us to go there.{nl}I can't be sure, but I believe there's something in Maven 31 Waters he was trying to hide from us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004974	Thanks again for your help, Revelator.{nl}We finally avenged our comrades' sacrifice, and we may not have the relic, but this Water Facility piece will be very useful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004975	Next time you come by, I hope you can finally see the lake restored to its old glory.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004976	I don't know who you are, but you need to run away! There are monsters out there waiting to attack.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004977	I'm too young to remember, but they say the plants weren't big like this before Medzio Diena!{nl}I guess cleaning out the plants wasn't as hard back then.{nl}By the way, you should get going now. There's monsters all over this place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004978	Tiger Hunter Master
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004979	Dirty creatures...{nl}You just wait...{nl}I'm gonna...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004980	Beasts and people both leave traces wherever they go.{nl}When you hunt, you need to hide yourself and wait for the prey to let its guard down.{nl}Then, you finish it off in one blow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004981	{nl}Otherwise, you may end up becoming the prey yourself.{nl}Like the people in my village...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004982	Kedoran Alliance Tadas
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004983	You're not just a regular traveler, are you?{nl}No one in their right mind comes up here, not even the adventurous ones...{nl}And I heard from the Alliance there's Revelator in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004984	{nl}They sent me here to gather the remains of the Outer Wall.{nl}I brought two other people to help me out at first but...{nl}All they do is fight, so I got no one helping me right now.{nl}Say, would you give me a hand?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004985	Heya.{nl}These are the two helpers I told you about.{nl}They're both stubborn as mules, and they haven't stopped fighting since we got here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004986	{nl}We should be wrapping up things here so we can go back, but with those two it's impossible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004987	I can't do anything the Alliance is asking me.{nl}Would you go out to the Watchman's Post and get some Yellow Fragments instead?{nl}I'm really sorry, kid...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004988	I'll try and convince those two meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004989	The nerve of those kids, not listening to their own boss...!{nl}I really don't know what to do with them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004990	I told them they were dismissed, that you were taking care of things.{nl}As soon as I tell them that, they go right after you!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004991	{nl}Can you believe this...?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004992	I mean, I know you're a famous Revelator and all.{nl}I reckon they just want a chance to work with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004993	{nl}But it's complicated, you know? I can't let them do that.{nl}Would you please just try and convince them?{nl}They should listen to you at least, right?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004994	The situation's tricky, you see.{nl}Nergui was born in Mors, but she was raised in the Alliance.{nl}And for some reason she doesn't seem to trust Wolke.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004995	{nl}I don't wanna send out the both of them with you, that'd be too much trouble.{nl}Would you take care of Wolke first?{nl}Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004996	Barbarian Wolke
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004997	Excellent choice!{nl}Alright, my time to shine.{nl}First things first, we head over to the Collapsed Assembly Area and take everyone down!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004998	{nl}Oh, right. The Master asked me to do something else first.{nl}You go ahead and get started.{nl}I'll just go talk to Tadas and I'll join you after that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_004999	It's me or the enemy!{nl}One of us has to die.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005000	All done.{nl}You're gutsier than you look, huh!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005001	{nl}He wants us to go up to the Northern Tournament Hall.{nl}We're supposed to get Shiny Glass Shards from the monsters there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005002	{nl}Go ahead if you're ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005003	Tadas told me you're a busy Revelator.{nl}How about you get going to the Northern Tournament Hall?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005004	That's a lotta Glass Shards right there.{nl}Not bad!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005005	There's a lot of stuff here you can't find in regular walls.{nl}Relics with the energy of the goddesses, things you'd see at a church...{nl}I wonder what the Alliance is gonna do with all of this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005006	I heard something interesting when I was back with the Alliance.{nl}They told me the Kedora Merchant Alliance was a thing even before the Capital.{nl}Apparently they're the ones who built this wall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005007	{nl}I mean, a single organization building something this big...{nl}I've been with them for decades now, but I still wonder if they're really just a normal merchant guild.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005008	{nl}This time I'd like you to go get some Cornerstone Pieces with Nergui.{nl}They said you could find some at the Weapons Assembly Area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005009	Kedora Alliance Nergui
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005010	I'm all about safety first, okay?{nl}Just keep that in mind if you're coming with me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005011	This oughta do it.{nl}I guess the Alliance always knows how to find these things...{nl}Secrets a low member like me can't even dream of.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005012	And the cornerstones were dragged all the way to the top of the wall...{nl}Isn't that weird?{nl}I thought it was a joke when the Alliance told me to come get them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005013	Think about it.{nl}These cornerstones are supposed to be under the ground.{nl}They're there to support the wall, doesn't make sense to have them on top.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005014	That tree root over there is all over the wall, how come the wall didn't just crumble?{nl}Just how deep... and how strong is it?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005015	{nl}I sent them each on a different task earlier. Can I have a word with you in the meantime?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005016	I think the Alliance is gonna try to either restore the wall or take anything of value and then sell it.{nl}The problem is that tree root.{nl}They can't just cut it off, the whole wall could crumble to the ground if they do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005017	{nl}So I wanna find out just how strong this root is.{nl}Can you help me out with that?{nl}I can't trust the other two to do this right...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005018	Say, you ever thought about quitting that Revelator life and working for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005019	{nl}If not, alright, I guess...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005020	This thing is heavy as an anvil...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005021	{nl}I should find the other two and send them back to headquarters now.{nl}Couldn't get anything done around here if it weren't for you.{nl}Thanks a lot, kid.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005022	Kedora Alliance Ineta
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005023	I should just quit the Alliance already...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005024	{nl}Oh! Um, hi. Are you exploring around here?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005025	{nl}Huh? Oh! You're that Revelator they talked about at the Alliance!{nl}Listen, I need you to save- I mean help me!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005026	Maybe I should just run away...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005027	{nl}Oh! That was nothing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005028	That's odd.{nl}When I used it, all I saw were merchants...{nl}Who is that woman?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005029	How about this?{nl}You're curious about it too, aren't you?{nl}I'll let you borrow it if you do me a favor. Hm?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005030	{nl}It's nothing big...{nl}I just want you to walk with it and bring me any objects that react to it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005031	Sigh... Maybe I should really run away now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005032	{nl}Oh! You're still here?!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005033	Woah... that's a lot.{nl}How did you carry all of this stuff?{nl}Can you carry the things and take them to Fedimian?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005034	{nl}What? You can't?{nl}Hm, okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005035	{nl}What's that pendant, though?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005036	I've never seen it before.{nl}We should take an image of it with the Time Meter.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005037	Go ahead, use it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005038	I'm from the south coast, so I never went through what the refugees did after Medzio Diena.{nl}But I hope the person in this image can be happy again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005039	Oh, thank the goddesses, my prayers have been answered!{nl}Will you come over to the Barrack Roof, then?{nl}There's something else I need you to do there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005040	I thought I'd be done here after a couple of days...{nl}I can't believe we have so much left to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005041	The name Pajauta is written on the back of the pendant.{nl}Do you think it could be the woman from the image?{nl}Hm... Who could she be?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005042	Where...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005043	{nl}Where did you get this?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005044	{nl}No, I won't ask anymore.{nl}Just know that this is a memory I wish I could forget.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005045	I don't know who this person is but...{nl}Please make sure they're well if you find them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005046	Just take this!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005047	I'm a Chronomancer, dispatched here by the Alliance.{nl}I was asked to investigate the events of Medzio Diena, but all they gave me was this necklace...{nl}They didn't tell me what to do with it.{nl}But I can't go beyond that bridge.{nl}The monsters would kill me!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005048	{nl}So please, would you help me?{nl}I want you to use this and check for any images in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005049	Schaffenstar Adjutant Apollonius
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005050	If you're trying to pass through, I would advise you not to.{nl}No, I cannot let you pass. The path ahead is far too dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005051	You're... awfully powerful.{nl}You don't seem like an ordinary outsider. May I ask who you are?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005052	A Revelator? You're the one I've been hearing about. I never thought I'd see the day!{nl}Is this the will of Laima...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005053	I'm so sorry for the sudden request, but we're in desperate need of assistance.{nl}It wasn't my intention to grab a hold of you like this, but will you listen to our plight?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005054	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Adjutant Apollonius, of the Schaffenstar.{nl}I'm in charge of protecting this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005055	This region is very important, you see, as it connects the Astral Tower to the Kingdom territories.{nl}That is why it has been protected from the demons since the beginning.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005056	One day, we heard rumors that our leader Ignas had made a pact with the demons himself.{nl}We didn't think that was possible, it was hard for us to believe in it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005057	Then recently, this area began to attract more and more demons, and soon enough our supplies had been cut off.{nl}Then the Tower superiors stopped paying attention to this region, and we knew the rumors were true.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005058	We were appalled. But we couldn't dare to abandon such a strategic location.{nl}We knew that if we tried, it would only cause the death of innocent people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005059	But now... we're at our limit. We're exhausted, and soon we'll be running out of supplies.{nl}We had our minds set, we wanted to endure this for as long as we could.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005060	And then you came.{nl}You're the only one who can turn this situation around, you... you're here now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005061	So I ask again: will you please help us?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005062	We need your power and the help of the Resistance forces to overcome this once and for all.{nl}Please, help us...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005063	Thank you! Oh, thank you!{nl}Thank Goddess Laima for leading you to us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005064	Allow me to explain our plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005065	Just come to me when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005066	Our goal is to get the most efficacy with the least damage taken.{nl}Many of our soldiers are tired and injured, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005067	Receiving material aid and manpower from the Resistance's side will be very important.{nl}But we also need to prepare for any incoming threats.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005068	We've managed to obtain the demons' battle instructions before. That is how we have been able to resist their attacks.{nl}I have studied the demon language, so I can read their documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005069	The instructions have been very helpful in telling us when the demons might attack.{nl}We would like to try the same method this time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005070	See whether you can find battle instructions or other documents from monsters in the area.{nl}The more, the better. Can we count on you for that?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005071	I learned the demon language from a bishop who had lived in my hometown since before the Schaffenstar.{nl}He was a very generous and considerate man.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005072	Thank you! I'll get to analyzing these documents right away.{nl}In the meantime, there's something else I'd like you to do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005073	These written documents are always very useful, but they don't tell us everything we need to know.{nl}Word of mouth is often just as important.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005074	I would like us to try and hear from the demons themselves, and see what it is that they are planning.{nl}For that, we will need to disguise ourselves as demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005075	The Druid Master is rather gifted with transformation, or so I've heard.{nl}Would you mind asking her if there is a way to disguise ourselves as demons?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005076	You know our situation now. I trust you to handle it with utmost care.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005077	Huh? You want to turn into demons?{nl}Why would you do that?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005078	Oh, I see...{nl}I'll let you have this, then. It's a transformation potion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005079	I developed the solution myself.{nl}It's still in the testing stages, but I can guarantee you it works.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005080	All you have to do is think of the demon you last saw, then drink this to take its form.{nl}I hope it's useful to the people you're trying to help. Alright, go ahead then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005081	I do hope the Druid Master can help us...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005082	Do you mean we can turn into demons with this potion?{nl}The last demon I saw...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005083	In that case, I believe we should disguise ourselves as Banterers. They're the leaders around here.{nl}It should be easier to obtain the information we need that way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005084	I really hope my potion can help you.{nl}Oh, if you can, do tell me how the transformation went after you take the potion. For my research, you know.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005085	Very well, it's time to use the potion.{nl}Make sure you take the form of a Banterer and collect any information you can from the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005086	Report back to me when you're done.{nl}Is that alright?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005087	I realize it's a dangerous tactic, but I do think it's the best way we have to investigate the enemy.{nl}We're counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005088	Oh, you're back.{nl}I've just finished collecting all the instructions and informing to the soldiers.{nl}What did you find?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005089	Are you saying...? They're summoning a Banshee Boss?{nl}They're going to try and end us once and for all...!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005090	There's no time to waste.{nl}We must tell the others about this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005091	Hurry and inform the soldier over to my left.{nl}They'll be quick to alert the rest of the forces.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005092	Then, go and see Resistance Adjutant Benjaminas in Barynwell 85 Waters.{nl}He's an old colleague of mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005093	He has worked here before, I'm sure he'll be willing to help us.{nl}I'll gather the soldiers and prepare our defenses in the meantime. Now go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005094	This is a matter of life and death. This attack could threaten the lives of our entire forces.{nl}We have no choice but to win. We must. For our own sake.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005095	Resistance Adjutant Benjaminas
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005096	Revelator?{nl}What are you...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005097	What? No, it can't be...{nl}If they fall, the Astral Tower and everything around it will be in danger!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005098	Thank you for the report. He did a great job holding on for so long...{nl}We'll be glad to help in any way we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005099	I'll inform our commander and gather the soldiers immediately.{nl}If the monsters attack before we arrive, please make sure they stay safe until we arrive. We'll be there as soon as possible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005100	What did he say? Will they help us?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005101	I see... That's good to hear. We only need to resist the attack until they arrive.{nl}Thank you, Revelator. This is all thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005102	All that's left to do is face the demons.{nl}This could very well become our last battle. Would you... be willing to join us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005103	If you hadn't found us... we wouldn't have made it alive for much longer.{nl}Our soldiers are tired and injured, dealing with the constant threat of demon attacks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005104	And yet we endured all that. We survived.{nl}All thanks to you and our comrades at the Resistance forces.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005105	Thank you, Revelator. Thank you for helping us protect our land.{nl}All we need now is for the Resistance to continue offering their help to keep it safe.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005106	Myself, I ought to tend to our injured soldiers before returning to oversee the region.{nl}You can rest assured that it will be safe now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005107	Go, Revelator. Find our goddess' Revelations and save this world from chaos.{nl}We are all counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005108	Wounded Soldier Spirit
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005109	Run... It's too dangerous... out here...{nl}They're coming... Please, hurry...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005110	You're... powerful...{nl}Thank you for saving me...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005111	Royal Soldier Spirit
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005112	I feel a lot better now. Thanks again for helping me.{nl}But I think the wave's already started to spread now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005113	All the other demons in the area are going to come rushing in.{nl}I don't even know if they're really demons. They could have been good spirits...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005114	A long time ago this land was cursed with a strange type of evil energy.{nl}That energy had always been dormant because of the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005115	But as you know, during Medzio Diena the Divine Tree grew out of control, and the evil curse was released.{nl}The strange energy started to spread, tearing away at people, demons, and all the creatures that lived here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005116	Anyone caught in the curse would eventually go mad and become like a slave to this evil energy.{nl}I was running away from the energy too, trying to escape the curse, but as you saw... it's dangerous out here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005117	If it weren't for you I'd be...{nl}Who... are you, by the way? You don't seem too affected by the energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005118	You're a Revelator? I see... That means...{nl}If anyone can save this place from the curse, it's you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005119	I can't do it on my own.{nl}We need to stop this evil energy and save the people who are suffering from it. Will you help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005120	Thank you, really.{nl}I want to find a way to stop this evil energy, even if we can't use the power of the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005121	We also need to find out how to cure the ones who are under the curse.{nl}The problem is I'm tied down here, I can't move.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005122	Would you find someone who can help us instead?{nl}I'm sure someone in the Kingdom can give us a solution.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005123	We should try the Taoist Master first. Please ask him if there's anything we can do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005124	Yes, I've heard a lot about that curse.{nl}But I'm afraid I can't clear out the evil energy there all by myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005125	What I can do is help you release those who are under the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005126	Let me give you some of my Purifiers.{nl}If you find anything that's spreading the evil energy, simply stick one of these sheets on it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005127	That should help clear out the area a little.{nl}Also, you might want to speak with the Exorcist Master. He should know more about this than me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005128	Would you go and ask him?{nl}I'm sure there's something he can tell you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005129	The Taoist Master wants me to see the Exorcist Master.{nl}I should go find him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005130	You should go and see the Exorcist Master.{nl}I'm sure he'll be able to help you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005131	If only we can stop this energy...{nl}It would make everything better...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005132	Oh, how I feel the pain of those poor souls.{nl}We are well aware of the terrible energy that's cursing that land.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005133	If you want to eliminate the energy once and for all, you'll first need to find its origin.{nl}That, of course, is no easy task. But if you're willing to try, I can give you these.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005134	This one is Purifying Holy Water. You may spray it on the victims after the curse is removed to cleanse their spirit.{nl}This one is a small Goddess Sculpture I received from the Dievdirbys Master.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005135	This sculpture has the power of the Dievdirbys Master and myself combined.{nl}I want you to place it on the spot where the energy is coming from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005136	The sculpture will help suppress the evil energy and stop it from spreading.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005137	You're back. What did you find?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005138	I see. I think I might know where the energy is coming from.{nl}But to get there you need to open a gate, and the mechanism that opens it is being guarded by demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005139	It shouldn't be too hard for you to take them down and get to the gate but...{nl}Like the two Masters, I also wish the people who are under the curse now could finally get some peace.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005140	I know it won't be easy, but would you go and take care of them first?{nl}You can use the Purifier sheets the Taoist Master gave you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005141	There are a few tombstones around here releasing the evil energy.{nl}Stick the Purifiers on the tombstones to keep it from spreading.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005142	If you use a Purifier, some spirits might try to attack you and get to the sheet.{nl}Make sure to be careful and stay safe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005143	I really hope we can stop this curse once and for all...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005144	How were the Purifiers, did they work?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005145	Good. I'm glad we could do something to help those poor people.{nl}But there are others still suffering from this curse. There's one more thing I need you to do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005146	You might have noticed that some of the demons out there are actually former soldiers who got transformed by the curse.{nl}I would like to save them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005147	Use the Exorcist Master's Purifying Holy Water on them to cure them of the curse and release their spirits.{nl}Like the Master said, the curse needs to be taken out of their bodies first, so you may need to make them weaker before using the water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005148	I hope it works. I just want my former comrades to finally rest in peace.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005149	Thank you. You really saved their souls.{nl}It should be easier for you to get to the gate mechanism now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005150	Here's what you need to do to suppress the curse.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005151	Go up through this path until you reach the Meeting Grounds.{nl}There you'll find the mechanism that opens the gate to the Drill Seargent's Lab, where I think the energy is coming from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005152	The thing is, to get to the mechanism, you first need to disable the protective barrier around it.{nl}After that you can turn on the mechanism and open the gate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005153	Put the Exorcist Master's Goddess Scuplture inside the room, wherever you see the energy coming from.{nl}Unfortunately I don't know how to get rid of the protective barrier, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005154	Also, whoever put this evil energy here in the first place might try to stop us if they figure out what we're doing.{nl}That's as much as I can tell you, I afraid. Sorry I can't help more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005155	I feel terrible knowing there's nothing I can do about this. But I still have hope.{nl}Revelator, please. Stop this curse and let this tragedy end once and for all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005156	I'm really sorry there's nothing else I can do.{nl}But you're the only one who can help us. Please... I beg you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005157	What happened? Is the energy... gone?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005158	I see. It sounds like the curse isn't completely over yet.{nl}But I'm glad we brought some peace to those poor souls. Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005159	But that means the lab wasn't the source of the curse... Then where is it...?{nl}I need to see the end of this curse with my own eyes, or I'll never be able to rest in peace.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005160	Until then, I want to do everything I can to stop other spirits from falling into this evil energy.{nl}Seeing your bravery inspires me to do more. It's only right for me to stay here and help in any way I can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005161	If you ever find any clues on how we can get rid of this energy, please come back to see me.{nl}Anything at all. I just want to end this curse as soon as possible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005162	I pray that your path will always be blessed by the grace of the goddesses.{nl}Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005163	Resistance Adjutant Antanina
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005164	Hey, you. Hold right there. Aren't you that Revelator everyone's talking about?{nl}Funny seeing you here, I was just looking for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005165	Did you just roll your eyes at me? Anyway... Oh, I never told you who I was.{nl}My name's Antanina. I'm a detached force adjutant for the Resistance army.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005166	We received reports of a portal around here that was supposedly made to ambush our forces.{nl}Our goal, of course, is to destroy it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005167	Now, we need to be fast and quiet. We were just trying to figure it out when you showed up.{nl}How about you give us a hand? The whole thing will be a lot faster if you do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005168	Listen. This is all for the good of the Astral Tower.{nl}If the Tower is safe, the whole lake is safe.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005169	We can bring back the lake's purifying powers.{nl}Then everyone who lives around it will be protected from the demons. Don't you wanna see that happen?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005170	Also, if we win this, the Schaffenstar gets to work in a much bigger area. That includes us, too.{nl}Think about it. We can finally go beyond the lake and help real people in need, just like what you're doing now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005171	Come on, you got nothing to lose here. Huh? Am I right?{nl}This is totally the right thing to do, you know it is. Just come talk to me when you're ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005172	Now we're talking!{nl}Alright, let me brief you on it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005173	The demon portal is being protected by four safety devices.{nl}Did you see any obelisks in the area? Well, those are the portal's safety devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005174	The obelisks are there to collect power and stabilize the portal.{nl}So the first thing we need to do is getting rid of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005175	Once we get rid of the obelisks, then we can destroy the portal. Simple, right?{nl}We don't expect you to take care of everything. We can do half of the obelisks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005176	For the portal, we're going to use this tool we got from our superiors.{nl}It's a kind of suppressor. The portal should be pretty weak without the obelisks, so this is gonna finish it off.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005177	I wrote everything down on this piece of paper.{nl}In case you forget.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005178	After the obelisks are down, we're going to meet up at the corridor between the Training Grounds and the Reception Room.{nl}Got it? Alright, let's get to it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005179	Okay, I'm gonna get going now.{nl}Go get the obelisk in the Armory first!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005180	It won't break by force alone. You need to find another way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005181	There are four obelisks powering the portal.{nl}You can find them at the Armory, Training Grounds, Reception Room and Graveyard.{nl}The Reception Room and Graveyard are further away, so we'll take care of those.{nl}You get the ones at the Armory and Training Grounds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005182	Inside the Armory you have different kinds of explosives.{nl}Just take some from the boxes or the barrels there and put them in front of the obelisk.{nl}Then, get a bomb and find a spot from where you can escape. Throw the bomb at the explosives to trigger the first explosion.{nl}All the other explosives should then cause a reaction and tear down the obelisk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005183	The obelisk in the Training Grounds is tougher.{nl}You'll see four platforms laid out in front of it.{nl}This obelisk can't be destroyed with explosives like the one in the Armory, so you'll have to use something else.{nl}I tried figuring out a way to take it down, but I came up with nothing so far. You'll have to get there yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005184	First, try hunting down a few demons and see if you can get any clues.{nl}You should find something related to those platforms.{nl}This obelisk is clearly different from the others, so there could also be a trap in it somewhere.{nl}Just keep that in mind and be careful when you try to destroy it.{nl}I know you can do it. We're all counting on you!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005185	When you're done taking down both obelisks, come to the corridor between the Training Grounds and the Reception Room.{nl}We'll meet you there.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005186	You're back! Phew, I'm impressed. Guess they don't call you a Revelator for nothing, huh?{nl}Time to take down that portal now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005187	Are you ready? We need to look out for any surprise attacks.{nl}Let's take it easy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005188	I should have been more careful... I can't believe Moringponia was here...{nl}That whirlwind attack was too strong, I couldn't even do anything...!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005189	But well... at least we can get to the portal now, thanks to you.{nl}You don't know how much this means to us. Thank you, really.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005190	Here, take the Suppressor.{nl}Just put it in front of the portal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005191	Our soldiers took a big blow earlier, we're not ready to start moving yet.{nl}You have to be the one to set it up. I'm sorry.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005192	That dirty Moringponia, what kind of attack was that...?!{nl}Nothing we did worked, nothing!! Makes me furious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005193	You did it. Thank you.{nl}We're finally safe. The Resistance, the Astral Tower, and everyone in the lake.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005194	We're gonna need a while to get patched up before we start looking into the rest of the demons.{nl}Now that their Lord is gone, we need to know what they're up to.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005195	As for you... Well, you're the Revelator. Go out and find those Revelations.{nl}If anyone can save this damned world, it's you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005196	Be strong, we got your back no matter what.{nl}And uh, make sure to give us a hand again if you ever come back, hehe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005197	There are demons ahead.{nl}You could become gravely injured. I highly recommend you don't go any further.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005198	The Resistance forces agreed to continue supporting us with material aid.{nl}Soon we will be safe again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005199	My only wish is to see our situation stabilized as soon as possible.{nl}Thank you. All of this was possible because of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005200	Uhh... The pain... Run... run away...{nl}You can't be here...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005201	You're back! Did you find anything about the curse?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005202	I see... Well, I'm glad you came to see me again.{nl}You don't have to bring me news every time, you can just come and hang out if you want. It gets... lonely in here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005203	What? Oh, sorry. Kinda busy here.{nl}If you're looking for the Resistance soldiers, check Barynwell 87 Waters.{nl}They should all be there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005204	Ugh, I still can't believe I fell for that attack, though.{nl}I used to think I was pretty good with ambush attacks. I guess I was too confident for my own good.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005205	I'll just have to learn my lesson and straighten up.{nl}But I'm rooting for you. I know you can get us out of this nightmare.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005206	Very well, here's what you need to do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005207	The platforms in front of the obelisk feel more solid than before.{nl}Maybe the demons around here can give you some clues about it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005208	Excuse me? Are you saying you saw a man dressed like me?{nl}Where was this?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005209	Oh... I see. The Resistance... You must be familiar with Commander Byle then.{nl}That is quite a coincidence. I know Byle very well, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005210	I can tell you more about it later. For now, here's what you should know about this area here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005211	Ah, Byle... Yes, the commander of the Resistance army!{nl}Did they take back the Astral Tower, then? Oh, that's wonderful news.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005212	I am actually very close to Commander Byle, yes.{nl}I can tell you more about it later but, for now, here's what you should know about this area here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005213	This is where Commander Byle used to work before he joined the Resistance against the Schaffenstar.{nl}He was always humble and discreet, a very hard-working man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005214	One day, he activated a device that was hidden here and got scolded by his superiors for not reporting it right away.{nl}We didn't understand why he did that at the time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005215	But then, on Medzio Diena, among all the chaos, this place was left relatively intact.{nl}It had to do with that device that Byle activated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005216	Byle didn't leave after he got scolded.{nl}He fought hard to protect this place after that, but Ignas' brutality ended up being too much for him to handle, so he left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005217	I was actually really sad about him leaving the Schaffenstar.{nl}We wanted to follow him to the Resistance forces but...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005218	We couldn't afford to move that far from own forces.{nl}A single soldier could mean the difference between fending off a strike and taking serious damage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005219	So we did what we could within the space we had.{nl}Gathering information on the enemy and things like that, I mean. That was... the most we could do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005220	Huh? So you know who we are?{nl}Then I'm sure you noticed that all we do is for the best, right?{nl}Everything, I mean EVERYTHING the Resistance does is for the good of this lake.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005221	Huh? So you know who we are?{nl}Then you must know why we're here, right?{nl}Everything the Resistance does is for the good of this lake, you know.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005222	We received reports of a portal around here that was supposedly made to ambush our forces.{nl}Our goal, of course, is to destroy it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005223	Somehow the powers of the lake are no longer activated.{nl}Usually the water of the lake would destroy the demons as soon as they touched it...{nl}No doubt this is all happening because of Ignas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005224	Kupole Astra
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005225	Oh! Revelator, what are you doing here...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005226	Oh my, I didn't even introduce myself.{nl}My name is Astra, I serve our Goddess Medeina.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005227	Master Medeina has gone into hiding, you see. I and the other Kupoles are searching for her in the forest.{nl}All the traces lead here but... unfortunately, that's as much as we know.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005228	Not only that, there seems to be an evil barrier covering Parias Forest.{nl}We worry that Master Medeina has fallen into danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005229	Revelator! Please help us find Master Medeina!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005230	Thank you!{nl}I'm sure we can find her with you on our side! You're the Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005231	This is where the traces end.{nl}We did look around for other clues, but there was nothing we could find...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005232	And so the other Kupoles and I decided to split and search for more clues around the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005233	Would you be so kind as to help with the search?{nl}Just in case I missed any clues around here... Do look again if you can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005234	Thank you!{nl}You can start with the Spindintis Lot!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005235	Did you look in the Spindintis Lot?{nl}I would like you to check there again, in case I missed anything important.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005236	You heard a song coming from a maple tree?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005237	[Lost butterflies will always wander towards the flowers.]{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005238	What could it mean?{nl}They're only common butterflies...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005239	Oh! Come to think of it, there is something odd about those butterflies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005240	Regular butterflies tend to fly around flowers...{nl}But these butterflies are found only in empty lots of land.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005241	We should see whether the butterflies react to those flowers you found.{nl}They could be an important clue.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005242	The butterflies' colors could also mean something.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005243	Did you check the butterflies?{nl}If they react to the flowers you found, that could give us a new clue.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005244	Revelator, did you hear the song coming from that tree over there?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005245	[Beyond the hill is a place the wings of the butterflies reach only in dreams.]{nl}Oh...! I know where the song is leading us!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005246	Down from here is a place called Drugelis Hill.{nl}The name Drugelis comes from the butterflies that live there...{nl}If my intuition is right, I believe we can find another clue there!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005247	This is odd.{nl}There isn't a single butterfly on the hill.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005248	All I see is flowers and trees.{nl}Revelator, I think the leaves you found earlier could be the clue we're looking for...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005249	{nl}Can you see if those flowers will react to your leaves?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005250	The flowers all have different colors.{nl}They must be connected to the colors of the leaves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005251	How did it go?{nl}Did the flowers react to the leaves?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005252	Oh, I knew it! Master Medeina must have left us these clues herself!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005253	[Those who guide the butterflies will be blessed by the trees in the shelter of life.]{nl}These lyrics seem to point to the Gyvenimas Shelter.{nl}That's the only shelter in this region.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005254	Hurry, to the Gyvenimas Shelter!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005255	If we let the Tantaliser go like this, we will all be in grave danger.{nl}But there is something we can do!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005256	As I told you when we first met, this forest is surrounded by an evil barrier.{nl}I don't know who could have created it but...{nl}I do know there's a Magic Stone in Grazus Cliff that powers the entire barrier.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005257	I suggest we use the power of that Magic Stone to tie down the Tantaliser.{nl}That ought to give us time to search for Master Medeina.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005258	I made sure to leave traces behind.{nl}The Tantaliser should come running any moment now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005259	The power of the Magic Stone is perfectly sealed. All we need to do is tie down the Tantaliser when she appears.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005260	We did it!{nl}The Tantaliser can't move anymore!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005261	This is our chance to look for more clues!{nl}Hurry, to the Gyvenimas Shelter! That's where the song was leading us!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005262	Let's go, hurry!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005263	Are these... seeds?{nl}Looking at them like this, they do seem to emit a sort of divine energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005264	If these seeds were hidden here by Master Medeina, they must be important.{nl}It will be best if you keep hold of the seeds for now.{nl}If we come to find Master Medeina, you should be the one to give them back to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005265	[Where the longing deer are welcome, the one blessed by the trees awaits you.]{nl}I wonder where this will lead us...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005266	Oh! The longing deer! It must mean the place where they go to drink!{nl}Beyond the Tesiamas Falls there is a spot called the Mazas Pond!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005267	The song must be leading us to the pond!{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005268	Uhh... I can't move.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005269	I'm going to need some time to recover...{nl}Please, carry on to the Mazas Pond.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005270	The pond is in front of the waterfalls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005271	There must be another clue at the Mazas Pond.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005272	So Master Medeina was being chased by Kartas.{nl}Oh... I understand now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005273	She went into hiding because of us.{nl}To protect us from Kartas...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005274	If you get to the center of Parias Forest, find a Kupole by the name of Ilona and alert her.{nl}She is also on the search for Master Medeina, she'll be able to help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005275	I will look for more help as soon as I recover.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005276	Is that true?{nl}If Kartas really is really after Master Medeina like you say, we're in serious trouble!{nl}That must mean Kartas was the one to put this evil barrier all around the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005277	Oh! Yes, I saw a Magic Stone like that at the Poilsis Pond!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005278	Sealing off the power of the Magic Stone could do something to help Master Medeina.{nl}Would you help me do it?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005279	Thank you!{nl}Let me give you this Sealing Scroll.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005280	You can use it to seal off the Magic Stone's power, just like you did to the other stone!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005281	The Magic Stone's power is all sealed off now!{nl}That was a close call with all the monsters, I can't believe you took them all down!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005282	There's a firefly, look!{nl}It must be guiding us to where Master Medeina is! We should follow it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005283	How glad I am to see you arrive safely.{nl}I am Medeina, Goddess of the Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005284	Never did I imagine that you would find these seeds.{nl}They possess immense power, you see. That is why I hid them where no one else could possibly find them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005285	My sister Laima once told that the one carrying these seeds would find their way to me in a time of danger.{nl}That day has now arrived.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005286	As you know, I am hiding from a vicious demon lord by the name of Kartas.{nl}I could not fight him myself, as I was gravely injured by Medzio Diena, and so I hid from him in this forest...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005287	{nl}Alas, he came to know of my whereabouts and produced a barrier to cover the entire region.{nl}These seeds, the ones we call the Seeds of the Divine Tree, have the power to restore my health, allowing me to face Kartas. But that is not possible now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005288	{nl}I must recover some of my power for the seeds to heal me completely...{nl}But as it is, I can barely stand on my own two feet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005289	I understand it is much to ask of you, but will you aid me in my recovery?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005290	Thank you.{nl}The Seed of the Divine Tree possesses regenerative properties.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005291	{nl}First take the seed to a dying plant.{nl}If you do so, the plant will regenerate and absorb part of the seed's powers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005292	{nl}Collect the revived plant and bring it to me.{nl}I may be unable to use the seeds as they are...{nl}But I believe this plant will help restore some of my health.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005293	You may bring some Dying Grass from near the Parias Falls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005294	Thank you.{nl}This will help me restore some of my health.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005295	Before I use the Seed of the Divine Tree, there is something I must do.{nl}First, I want to produce a false seed to fool Kartas. Then, I will need to seal away the seed's powers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005296	{nl}If I attempt this on my own, Kartas might be able to sense my movements.{nl}Therefore I must ask: are you willing to help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005297	Thank you.{nl}You must hurry, there is no time to waste.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005298	Please, hurry.{nl}Kartas could find us at any moment.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005299	The preparations are over.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005300	The power held by this Seed of the Divine Tree is far greater than I imagined.{nl}Its regenerative properties are astounding.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005301	{nl}I will use this power to produce a false seed that will fool Kartas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005302	There are a few young maple trees on the path to Syla Forest.{nl}If you bring the seed to those trees, it will grow them instantly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005303	{nl}Using the seed to grow one of those trees is a violation of the laws of Nature.{nl}Therefore, as quickly as it grew, the tree will soon perish.{nl}Before the tree dies, you must collect one of its branches and bring it to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005304	{nl}Kartas will not know of the Seed of the Divine Tree. Perhaps only vaguely.{nl}If we can disguise the branch, we can fool Kartas into thinking it is important.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005305	Take a close look on the path to Syla Forest.{nl}There you will find the young maple trees.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005306	You've done it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005307	The Seeds of the Divine Tree possess extraordinary powers.{nl}Should they fall in the hands of Kartas or any other demon, the results will be catastrophic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005308	{nl}I would like to seal away the seeds' powers, so that they may be used solely for my restoration.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005309	Long ago, I had altars built at the Paslaptis Lot for this purpose.{nl}Activate the altars starting from the lowest, then place the Seed of the Divine Tree on the last altar.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005310	{nl}The energy contained in the altar will surround the seed and begin to seal away its powers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005311	There are multiple altars at the Paslaptis Lot.{nl}I did not want their energy to be compromised.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005312	{nl}You may activate the altars starting from the bottom.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005313	Good, the power of the seeds is sealed safely now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005314	We're ready.{nl}It's time to restore my health.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005315	{nl}May I have the seeds now?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005316	Aahhh... I put us all in danger.{nl}I just saw him take Master Medeina and I... I'm sorry.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005317	I don't see Ilona.{nl}I need to see what's happening.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005318	There are more demons here than I imagined.{nl}I think we should look for Ilona together.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005319	Let's go look for her!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005320	Thank you, Revelator.{nl}All I've done was delay Master Medeina's rescue...{nl}{nl}I am so ashamed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005321	But there is something at the center of Parias Forest that Master Medeina left me.{nl}I suppose she wanted me to use it in an emergency like this...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005322	She gave me one of her orbs and told me to use it whenever I needed to find her.{nl}It was that very orb that brought me to this forest in the first place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005323	I could use Master Medeina's orb again to follow her but...{nl}I'm worried that we might end up falling for one of the demons' traps instead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005324	Would you help me find Master Medeina with this orb?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005325	You can use the orb to find Master Medeina's traces.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005326	I don't see any more traces.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005327	I think we should go further into the courtyard.{nl}This might be dangerous, but we're already at the end of the path...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005328	There could be other clues in here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005329	Let's go inside!
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005330	You've come to rescue me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005331	Kartas is planning to take me to the demon realm.{nl}He has me confined with this Teleportation Magic Circle. I cannot escape.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005332	If only there was a way to disable this magic circle...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005333	The Support Magic Circles you see here are supplying power to this Teleportation Magic Circle.{nl}If you destroy them, the Teleportation Magic Circle will grow weaker.{nl}Only then can I destroy this barrier with my own power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005334	I don't believe the Support Magic Circles can be destroyed by force alone, however.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005335	I would like you to defeat the Red Banterers and bring me their essence.{nl}Should we overload the magic circles with it, we may just be able to destroy them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005336	Defeat the the Red Banterers and bring me their essence.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005337	Have you got the Red Banterer Essence?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005338	Yes, this should suffice.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005339	You may add the essence to the magic circles.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005340	I was able to destroy the barrier.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005341	The seed did restore my condition somewhat...{nl}But I am still trapped inside the forest barrier.{nl}I believe we need to seal away the Magic Stone that's supplying power to the barrier as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005342	I sense a concentration of magic energy near the Paprastas Lot.{nl}The Magic Stone is likely to be there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005343	Revelator, will you seal away the Magic Stone?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005344	Take this Sealing Scroll and place a seal around the Magic Stone.{nl}I will be preparing for my escape in the meantime.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005345	Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005346	Was there a Magic Stone at the Paprastas Lot?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005347	Yes, the barrier feels much weaker.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005348	I ought to hurry now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005349	But my Kupoles...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005350	No. Revelator, you take the seed and abandon the forest immediately.{nl}It's the seed's powers that Kartas covets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005351	I must go back. I worry too much for my Kupoles.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005352	I wasted the time that was given to me...{nl}Laima tried to warn me, yet I did not listen.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005353	She told that Kartas would one day become a threat, that he would seek me.{nl}And that a choice would present itself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005354	My call to Miss Neringa was far too late... and now Master Medeina is...{nl}Oh, what gruesome fate...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005355	The Mazas Pond is just after the waterfall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005356	I'm tending to my guns now.{nl}Will you come back later?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190419_005357	{nl}Also, would you step back a little?{nl}I'm not too comfortable with you coming so close.

QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005857	Also... our mentor is back and he wants to talk to you in private.{nl}I'll be setting up things so we can start searching the Old Concert Hall area in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005858	Ah. Welcome, Revelator.{nl}I heard news of you arriving during my search. As you know, we're looking for the relic that will let us take over the Barynwell areas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005859	My students told me you helped them take down the demons.{nl}We are very grateful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005860	As their mentor, I apologize for letting them pull you into all this trouble.{nl}That said, if you do agree to help us, finding the relic will only be a matter of time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005861	I know my students must have complained to you about what's been happening.{nl}But now that the portal is destroyed, we can finally search the Old Concert Hall.{nl}That's the only area we haven't searched yet.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005862	I'm certain that the relic will be there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005863	I gave out orders to begin the search there already.{nl}Please, have some rest before you join us. I understand you just went through a difficult battle.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005864	You're back.{nl}We managed to find our colleagues' keepsakes in the meantime.{nl}Thank you for the help, really.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005865	We also found a hidden location in the Old Concert Hall.{nl}Let me show you what was inside.{nl}This is...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005866	Thank you.{nl}I'm glad you are as kind as you are talented.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005867	We wouldn't have gotten our defense back up so quickly without you.{nl}Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005868	Are you sure? That's... very kind of you, thank you.{nl}To tell you the truth, many of our soldiers were injured in the last battle.{nl}I'm glad you're here to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005869	You're done already?{nl}Well, you really can't beat experience, can you?{nl}I'm honestly impressed, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005870	Thank you for your service.{nl}The last battle was hard on us, many were injured during the conflict.{nl}This time you truly gave us the upper hand.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005871	Before you arrived, we had other confrontations with the monsters.{nl}Each one left several of our soldiers injured.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005872	The problem is that they keep coming, while our forces grow weaker and weaker.{nl}The soldiers' morale is lower than ever.{nl}Do you think you can help lift their spirits a little?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005873	Thank you, Revelator.{nl}I sent him a carrier pigeon earlier, so he should know you're coming.{nl}To get to the Collapsed Shelter, just go up this way and take a left before you reach the entrance to the Observatory.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005874	Revelator! Hello!{nl}I'm a student of Mr. Brockal Himil, the one who's investigating the monsters.{nl}Mr. Himil told me you helped our forces back at the camp.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005875	Thank you, Revelator.{nl}I'll go and set up some bombs at Maven Intersection.{nl}You can do the same around the Collapsed Observatory.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005876	The bombs are all set.{nl}Time to lure in the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005877	I can't believe you took down that monster before I could even send out a carrier pigeon...{nl}You really are something special.{nl}I admire you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005878	That was close, I'm glad you were around to help me.{nl}Let's report back to Mr. Himil.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005879	Revelator! We heard a monster, I was just about to gather our forces.{nl}What on earth just happened?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005880	I'm still amazed that you took down the leader on your own.{nl}And thank you for saving my student.{nl}We're really fortunate to have you here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005881	Thank you.{nl}I was so nervous, I'm glad you were here to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005882	Thank you, Revelator!{nl}I'll protect this lake with my own life.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005883	I was so afraid all this time...{nl}But no more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005884	I know we're going to win this battle with you.{nl}I'm never going to give up. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005885	Hi there. Are you a traveler?{nl}Be careful around here, this place has been full of monsters and water plants since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005886	A Revelator... oh, you're the Revelator!{nl}I guess I was worried for nothing, then.{nl}I heard that you help people you are in trouble... Can you help me too?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005887	Oh, thank you!{nl}Ever since Medzio Diena, the water plants around here have been growing bigger and faster.{nl}It's been getting harder and harder for me to take care of the lake.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005888	Would you help me get rid of the water plants around the watch post?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005889	Wow, you're great at getting rid of those heavy water plants!{nl}I can't even pick them up.{nl}If I become a member of the Schaffenstar, will I be strong like you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005890	You don't have to move all of them!{nl}Just take some and I'll do the rest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005891	You moved all of them?{nl}Wow, that was enough work for half a day... Thank you.{nl}Now let me show you how to process the plants with the machine.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005892	Um, Revelator... We have a problem.{nl}I never tried to process this many plants...{nl}I don't think my magic source is gonna be enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005893	I'm gonna get some more magic sources.{nl}You just wait here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005894	What? You wanna help?{nl}But you already helped me move the plants... Thank you!{nl}You can find some magic sources at the Old Warehouse. They're like shiny stones, you'll see them right away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005895	You helped go through so many water plants.{nl}Thank you!{nl}If that's okay, will you help our leader at the Laker Temporary Base too?
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005896	I see. You're a Revelator. I'm sorry for being so suspicious.{nl}Most of us Lakers come from villages around the lake.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005897	So... we can handle the plants now, but the monsters are another story.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005898	I learned how to fight from a mentor who's no longer with us.{nl}But most of the Lakers were never trained in combat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005899	I learned how to make poison from my mentor.{nl}They're a famous hunter, you see.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005900	They had to leave because of something, but they should be back someday.{nl}And be careful, the Old Stakeout Box is still full of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005901	Great.{nl}I hope the monsters didn't give you too hard of a time out there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005902	The giant one is still knocked out from the spiked bait.{nl}We should get going before it wakes up.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005903	That was fast.{nl}I've just finished the poison, too.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005904	Time to take care of that giant monster.{nl}Sigh... I'm a little nervous.{nl}I'll be counting on you for this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005905	Glad to see you're safe, Revelator.{nl}I'm sorry I couldn't help.{nl}I don't know what would happen to me if you weren't around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005906	Uhh... this wound's more serious than I thought.{nl}I need to have it checked back at the camp.{nl}I'm really sorry, Revelator, but there's one more favor I want to ask of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005907	You got the materials. Great.{nl}This should keep us safe for a while.{nl}But of course,  we'll need to be on the lookout for any new threats.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005908	The borders are safe for now,{nl}but the monsters have been acting strange recently.{nl}I really don't know what to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005909	I did have my qualms about Mr. Himil, but deep down I really trusted him.{nl}When he first stepped up as our leader, he was a really honorable man.{nl}I don't know what made him change like that...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005910	I will reorganize the party for the time being.{nl}I am way too tired, both body and mind.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005911	When we are done, we will make preparations to reclaim the area.{nl}We need to study the equipment parts that we've found and ask for help and...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005912	I still don't get it...
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005913	I know it's suspicious, but we can't help but agree to his terms as we have no other choice.{nl}Revelator. Do not hesitate to back away when you find something suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005914	Sigh... Oh my, this is really getting out of my hand.{nl}There... There must be a way...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005915	Oh, I didn't see you there. I was thinking too hard to notice someone approaching.{nl}Wait... Maybe you could...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005916	Will you lend me an ear for a second? This is very important.{nl}The future of the entire Kingdom... Or even, mankind is at stake.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005917	As always, I was honing my mastery of the moon's shadow.{nl}Then I got the idea to enter the shadow of the moon itself in order to better understand my craft.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005918	I've tried acting out my theory but I wasn't powerful enough so I thought to harness the power of the moon itself.{nl}When I performed the necessary rites, a mysterious portal opened before me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005919	At first, I thought my hypothesis was correct and entered the portal, thinking it would lead me inside the moon's shadow.{nl}But inside the portal, I found myself in a strange landscape.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005920	It was different from where we are now... A strange dimension that existed on a different plane from our own.{nl}I was disappointed and attempted to return to my world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005921	I turned around to head back out through the portal which I entered.{nl}It was then that I heard a frightening roar. That dark and grotesque energy...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005922	I turned to see a large demon standing in front of me. It was...{nl}It was trying to head out into our world through the portal I had created.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005923	I don't know why the demon was there, but I knew one thing through my instinct.{nl}I realized quickly that if the demon escaped through the portal it would pose a great threat to our world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005924	I had mustered all the strength I had to bind the demon in its place.{nl}On top of that, I crafted some devices in preparation for the worst case scenario, returned to our world and closed the portal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005925	But that wasn't enough. The demon's power is so great that even as we speak, I can feel that it is slowly freeing itself from the spell I had put on it.{nl}If it breaks free... And enters our world... I don't know what would happen...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005926	We cannot let this demon go free. I need a lot of help in order to keep the demon bound in its dimension.{nl}You are a revelator, are you not? Could you lend me your strength?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005927	I need all the help I can get in order to resolve this crisis at hand.{nl}Please, save the world from its certain doom by stopping this terrible demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005928	Thank you. I feel assured to have your word that you will help.{nl}It will be an arduous battle. Come back and talk to me again after you have made the preparations.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005929	Now, I will open the portal... I mean the dimensional rift that will lead us to where the demon is.{nl}As I've said before, you will find a few devices that I have built in order to stop the demon getting free.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005930	It will not activate right away as it was put together in a haste.{nl}But if it does activate, eventually, it will be helpful to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005931	Brace yourselves, and enter through the portal when you're ready.{nl}I will follow you shortly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005932	I will help you carry the Water Plants.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005933	It looks too heavy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005934	Help defeat the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005935	It's going to be okay.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005936	Go to the designated area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005937	I need some time to prepare.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005938	I will gather the materials for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005939	I want to rest for a bit.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005940	From a Mistake to a Threat
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005941	I can't do it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005942	Placing the flesh of Black Hohen Olben
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005943	Eclipse Ubik, the Shadowmancer Master, seems to be worried about something. Talk to the Shadowmancer Master and ask her what's wrong.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005944	The Shadowmancer Master needs help sealing away the demon she had come across during her studies. The demon is very powerful so she needs capable adventurers to assist her. Talk to the Shadowmancer Master when you're ready.
QUEST_LV_0400_20190611_005945	Talk to Kupole Ilona and defeat the Red Banterers in the vicinity to collect %s.
