QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000023	It's sneaking into the Pyromancer Master's room and opening a box. {nl}As for what's inside the box...Well, you'll just have to kill it off.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000024	This will be enough. {nl}My magic is not easy, so you will need to work hard to keep up. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000025	Your will to learn from me is good, but first I have a favor to ask. {nl}We can continue our talk if you are up for it. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000026	Lydia Schaffen's gears are like divine materials to us archers. {nl}I would give up my entire fortune just to have them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000027	I never imagined that I would see this myself. {nl}Thank you. I will teach you thoroughly from now on, so you better be prepared.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000045	Now go to Gintara Highway at Spineheart Dale.{nl}Sprinkle this liquid medicine onto the experimental Matsum doll that I installed and let me know the result.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000046	The Matsums attacked you? {nl}Since the Matsums accepted the Matsum dolls as their friends, I consider it successful.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000050	Temperament is very important for Linkers. {nl}While it may be easy to shut out one's heart, opening it up requires a special kind of temperament. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000051	I will test you to see if you have such temperament.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000055	Normal people are only capable of seeing reality as is, but if you have the temperament of a Linker, {nl}you should be able to perceive a hidden world. {nl}Find the book from there and bring it to me. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000056	Have you gone there yet? {nl}Just go to the Gate Route and check. I've marked the location on the map.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000057	Looks like you found the book. With this, you have passed my test. {nl} Nevertheless, please read that book to demonstrate your determination as a Linker. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000058	So you want me to teach you the skills of a Sapper... well then you must customarily pay a fee for my service. {nl}Not to me. But rather, I want you to give a donation to the Cleric Master in Klaipeda. {nl}Let's say, around 5000 silver? 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000059	Wait, there's one more thing. {nl}I hid some objects at Flude Island in the Siauliai Western Woods.{nl}Before you go to Klaipeda, find the objects first and return them to their original owners in Klaipeda.{nl}{nl} 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000060	Oh, this. I saw it somewhere...hmm...it looks familiar...{nl}Well I'll take it with gratitude since you're giving it to me.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000062	Did you forget about the donation? {nl}It's 5000 silver.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000063	Cleric Master
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000064	Thank you, in the name of the goddess.{nl}I promise the donations will be used for those injured by monsters. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000065	I used to be a thief, but I came to realize certain things and I stopped my criminal life. {nl}But there is a small matter left on my mind... and I want to resolve it now. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000066	Anyway, you did a good job. {nl}Let's cooperate from now on, teaching and learning from each other. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000067	I'm looking for a book. Four books by Lydia Schaffen. {nl}If you help me find the books, I will teach you my skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000068	The book used to be in Miners' Village, but it was lost when the Vubbes raided. {nl} Try visiting the Vubbe Outpost.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000069	This is the book. You will need this book if you dream to be the best Archer. {nl}I will make you a copy if you can gather the entire book collection. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000070	The Quarrel Shooter Master holds the next book. {nl}He was looking for Merog leather earlier. Maybe you can try making a deal with him using that.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000071	Do you have the Merog leather yet from the Hunter Master?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000072	This is of good quality. The Hunter Master will be pleased. {nl}You can take the book. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000073	Merogs are in the Fallen Worry Forest, and the Quarrel Shooter Master is in Klaipeda. {nl}Someone might get ahead of you, so better hurry.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000074	The Archer Master in Klaipeda has the next book. {nl}He's not a mean person, so he will give you the book if you ask nicely. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000075	He is helping with the repair of the damaged city wall. {nl}I heard the rocks are delivered from the Miners' Village, so bringing some to him can be a way to ask. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000076	Did the Hunter Master tell you to send this? {nl}If you're looking for Lydia Schaffen's book, you could have just asked. But thanks anyway. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000077	The last book is with the Ranger Master in Klaipeda. {nl}Give her this pouch. {nl}I could go myself, but we're not really comfortable seeing each other. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000078	Don't ask why. Work is work, and it's a fact that we don't want to see each other. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000079	This pouch...Did you come from the Hunter Master? {nl}Here. Take this book to her. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000080	Although that woman acted humble to you, she's pretty scary whenever she approaches me. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000081	This will be enough leather. {nl}Bring them to the Quarrel Shooter Master before someone else does. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000082	This rock will be useful in repairing the wall. {nl}Bring it to the Archer Master quickly. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000083	Are you the one who wants to learn my skills? {nl}Great, I was just looking for someone to help me find Lydia Schaffen's book. {nl}You're going to help, right? 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000084	There was one volume in the Miners' Village, but it was lost when the Vubbes raided. {nl} I'm pretty sure it's in the Vubbe Outpost now.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000085	Ho-ho yep, this is it. {nl}This will be helpful for people like you, who dream of becoming a Quarrel Shooter. {nl}I will give you a copy if you collect the entire book collection. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000086	Three more left. {nl}I think you can get one of them by giving some money to the Hunter Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000087	The problem is, I'm broke. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000088	You mean Lydia Schaffen's book that I have? {nl}I'll hand it over for 5000 silver.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000089	You heard me right, please pay the price . {nl}Around 5000 silver will do. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000090	5000 silver...Yup, that's right. {nl}I'll give you the book as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000091	Well...the Archer Master must have the next book. {nl}He's still helping repair the wall, so wouldn't he appreciate it if you got him some rocks? {nl}I could take them to him myself, but...owwww...my back.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000092	The Archer Master has the next book. {nl}He's not a mean person, so he will give you the book if you ask nicely. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000093	I heard he is helping repair the damaged city wall. {nl}Rocks were delivered from the Miners' Village, and he'll be moved if you bring him one. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000094	Did the Hunter Master told you to send this? {nl}If you're here for Lydia Schaffen's book, you could have just asked. But thank you anyway. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000095	Now, for the last book. {nl}Give this pouch to the Ranger Master and get the book. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000096	Did the Quarrel Shooter Master send this? {nl}Thanks. I'll hand over the book as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000097	Bring the book quickly. {nl}I can't hold it. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000098	Great, it's this one! {nl}I'll teach you the skills of a Quarrel Shooter as promised. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000099	This rock will be useful in repairing the wall. {nl}Bring it to the Archer Master quickly. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000100	If you want to learn more of my skills, there is a condition. {nl}I want you to help me find the four books by Lydia Schaffen. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000101	I heard the first book was with a resident in Miners' Village before the Vubbes attacked. {nl}So I think it could be in the Vubbe Outpost now. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000102	I'm surprised you found it so fast! {nl}And it's in good condition. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000103	I think you might be able to buy the next book from the Hunter Master...{nl}I'm broke after paying to fix the wall. Haha...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000104	You mean the second book by Lydia Schaffen? {nl}I'll hand it over for 5000 silver. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000105	I think around 5000 silver will do. {nl}I heard that's the book's value. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000106	Ah, you came at the right time.{nl}If you could take Merog leather to the Quarrel Shooter Master, he will make you a copy of the next volume.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000107	Did the Merog leather come from the Archer Master?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000108	You will find Merogs at the Fallen Worry Forest.{nl}Take those to the Quarrel Shooter Master in Klaipeda.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000109	The quality is fine enough. The Archer Master will be pleased. {nl}Here, I've prepared a copy, so take it. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000110	Now there is one book left. {nl}Give this pouch to the Ranger Master and get the book. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000111	Did the Archer Master send you? {nl}Well, good work. I'll give you the book as promised.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000113	Finally, it's all here. {nl}I'll teach you my skills as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000114	I have some books to collect. They're Lydia Schaffen's books. {nl}I'll teach you my skills if you collect the books. What do you say? 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000115	The first book was in the Miners' Village, but it disappeared after the Vubbes attacked. {nl}I assume the book is in the Vubbe Outpost? 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000116	Oh, that's pretty good. {nl}It will be helpful for you to read it too. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000117	The problem is the Hunter Master. I really don't want to see her face. {nl}So you go and get the next book from her. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000118	You mean the book I have? {nl}Well, okay. I'll hand it over for 5000 silver. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000119	I think around 5000 silver will do. {nl}Can you spare that much? 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000120	You came at the right time.{nl}The Quarrel Shooter Master told you that if you could bring Merog leather, he will make you a copy of the next volume.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000121	Didn't the Ranger Master tell you anything?{nl}I asked him for Merog leather.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000122	Merogs are at the Fallen Worry Forest and the Quarrel Shooter Master is in Klaipeda. {nl}Someone may go there and get the book faster than you, so please hurry.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000123	The book is in good condition.{nl}Now, bring the book to the Archer Master. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000124	The Archer Master in Klaipeda has the last book. {nl}I heard he is repairing the wall, so this might help you get the book. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000125	I heard there is a rock that will be useful for repairing the wall in the Miners' Village. {nl}Bring that to the Archer Master as a present. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000126	Did the Hunter Master told you to send this? {nl}If you're here for Lydia Schaffen's book, you could have just asked. But thank you anyway. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000127	You finally collected them all. Good work. {nl}I will teach you my skills as promised, but it's your job to keep track and follow along.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000128	You got some good quality leather. {nl}Bring it to the Quarrel Shooter Master. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000129	Why did you bring that to me? Take it to the Archer Master quickly.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000130	Sculptor Tesla
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000131	A sculptor's talent is important, but so is having an eye for seeing important materials. {nl}I will help you learn my skills if you bring me the blue crystals I'm looking for. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000132	That is the problem. {nl}The Yekub swallowed it as soon as it was found on the 2nd Floor of the Miners' Village. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000133	Oh, this is it. {nl}I have a lot of time, so I will teach you thoroughly.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000134	You want to learn the swordsmanship of a Highlander from me? {nl}I will consider it if you can get cooperation from the Peltastas.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000135	As compensation for seeking cooperation, just support 5 boards of wooden buckler type.{nl}Defeating Upents at Indigo Trees Plateau will be enough.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000136	Thank you for the supplies, but the Highlander Master wouldn't have sent you for just that. {nl}Tell me what you want. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000137	An overall cooperation between the Masters? Certainly. {nl}Tell him that the Peltastas will cooperate. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000138	If the Masters unite, it won't be long until the kingdom rises again. {nl}You did a good job. I will teach you my swordsmanship.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000139	That should be enough. {nl}Now go seek the cooperation with the Peltasta Master. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000140	We Peltastas promised the Highlanders we would lend our forces to rebuild the kingdom.{nl}So if you want to learn from me, you should also be responsible.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000141	Meet Uska and lend your force.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000142	So you came here at the request of the Peltasta Master.{nl}The Highlander Master once guaranteed that he would get support from the other masters. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000143	We, Peltastas, consider our duties as humans to be most important. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000144	We, Peltastas, consider our duties as humans to be most important. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000145	I was about to ask for aid in the search. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000146	I sent 4 scouts to the Spineheart Dale, but they all disappeared.{nl}Maybe they didn't think the Thorn Forest was that dangerous... Please find them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000147	Some issue may have emerged.{nl}Please go to the Spineheart Dale quickly.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000148	These...were their keepsakes. {nl}We can at least give the keepsakes to their families. Thank you. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000149	I will tell the Highlander Master myself, so please go back. {nl}Good work. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000150	It might not be a pleasant feeling, but that's good enough. {nl}I will allow you to learn the way of the Peltasta as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000151	I need to gather the energy of fire for my research, but I just don't have time. {nl}If you gather it for me, I will help you learn the magic of Pyromancers.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000152	Be careful. The pot will break if you don't keep an eye on it. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000153	Please put this pot on the ground when you go to the Descended Tree Garden.{nl}After that, when you defeat the enemies nearby, energies will be accumulated in the pot.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000154	There is an important book that I'm looking for. {nl}If you get me that book, I will help you learn the magic of Cryomancers. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000155	Did you say you'll find the book? {nl}Sorry, but you're late. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000156	I heard rumors that it's in the Miners' Village, but I don't know the exact location of it. {nl}Maybe the Mayor would know...

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000375	Did the Archer Master worry? I'm fine. {nl}If there's a problem, it's that the materials can't follow my crafting speed.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000386	You want to learn my skills? {nl}I'll think about it if you get me the tree I'm looking for.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000394	It's hard to stray away from the charm of poison. I'm one of them. {nl}I'll let you know how appealing it is too. Let's start slowly from today on.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000395	It is your assignment to find the hidden monsters.{nl}The location is the Purple Tree Forest.{nl}If you wish to be a Scout, you should be able to do this. Don't you think so?

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000397	It was easier for you to do than I thought.{nl}Great. I think it'll be fun to teach you. {nl}Come to me anytime you want to learn from me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000398	I think you're good enough to be accepted as my disciple but you still need to be tested. {nl}I will welcome you if you bring the rubbings of Lydis Schaffen's gravestone in the Goddess' Ancient Garden.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000404	I thought it would be difficult but you're great at it. {nl}I will teach you the skills slowly so you better warm up first.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000405	You need to show your bravery if you want to learn from me. {nl}Use this note to provoke the monsters at Penitence Route. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000406	Are you brave enough to turn the enemy's blade to you when your allies are in danger?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000407	I can picture them full of anger. {nl}You've passed the test. You're good enough to learn from me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000408	You want to learn from me? Then there's something you should do for me. {nl}Teach the Hackapell Master who believes that there's something in the world that can't be penetrated.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000410	If that fellow asks, I'll proudly tell him that our skilled Hoplite took it down. {nl}I will acknowledge you with this.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000411	You want to learn from me? {nl}Then you have to pass a test. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000412	I heard the other Masters are sending their disciples to defeat Yekub in the Cathedral. {nl}But that is what you must bring an end to. Go now.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000413	If you have the ability to learn from me, then Yekub will be easy enough.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000414	I want to see their faces when they fight a Yekub that doesn't even exist. {nl}Alright, you're good enough.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000415	You came here to learn the Formations of a Centurion?{nl}Then first I gotta find out if you're competent enough to command other people.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000416	You can meet Colimencia when you go to the Layered Rock Forest.{nl}You must be competent enough to defeat it in order to become a Centurion.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000417	You're welcome to become a Centurion. {nl}You'll learn step by step about the Centurion formation from now on.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000418	Squires are strong but helping our partners is where we shine. {nl}Using the rope to make connecting attacks with fellow allies {nl}is an attack that is notably stronger than any other attacks.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000420	In order for connecting attacks to succeed, nobody can make any mistakes. {nl}That is why you need to practice hard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000421	How comfortable are you with it? {nl}I will teach you thoroughly as promised.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000422	I heard the monster called Biteregina keeps threatening people at the Sunset Flag Forest.{nl}If you could defeat it, I will teach you my skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000423	Since I am a Master, I should also help other people, but I just don't have enough time.{nl}Anyway, as I promised to you, I will teach you my skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000424	Going through these dangers can be a good experience.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000425	The Peltastas requested help. {nl}We have limited troops but we also can't reject the Peltastas as we have a pledge with them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000426	I want you to assist the Peltastas and carry out the mission.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000427	We, the Peltastas, receive shield supplies as a condition for keeping our pledge with the Highlanders. {nl}The shields have always been delivered on time but recently the supplies have been cut. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000428	Ask the Highlanders what the problem is and if you can, please solve it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000429	If you say so, there is a way.{nl}If you could defeat the Moas at Crystal Brook that destroyed my ingredients, I will shift your turn ahead.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000430	I'm following the traces of Evoniphons.{nl}Recent information says that they tested something in the Cathedral.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000431	Go to the Cathedral right away and get a sample of Moya's fluid. {nl}We'll should know something after examining it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000432	I'll give you this flare since you're a novice. {nl}It'll help you find the monsters efficiently.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000433	Poison is a two-sided blade, so you should be careful with it. {nl}Especially if you get a finger cut while using poison..
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000434	I assume you've come to learn something from me because you have the ability. {nl}To win a duel against me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000435	Go to the vacant area above the stairs and wait. {nl}I'll be there after finishing this up.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000436	You're faster than you look. {nl}I will teach you my skills from now on, so come anytime.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000440	With your abilities, the Reaverpede in Lonesome Market should be easy to defeat. {nl}If you can't do that, I can't take you on as a Ranger apprentice.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000441	I'm relieved you're here. {nl}Everyone is focused there but only us Rangers are not dispatched.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000442	I heard you were a step faster than the Hunters. {nl}Good work. I'm a very strict teacher so you better be prepared.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000443	Teaching you the skills of the Scouts isn't difficult. {nl}But you need to have the capability to follow it, don't you think?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000444	Alright then. {nl}Deadborn appeared at Ruklys Road but the troops there need help. {nl}This should be fairly good hunting material.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000445	Good job. You did better than I expected. {nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn something.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000446	So you want to learn Sapper skills from me? That's a good idea. {nl}I'm currently lacking materials for a new trap.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000447	So you will need to help me with it. {nl}You'll need to defeat the Rocktortuga at Ruklys Memorial and bring me Natural Mano Stones.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000448	Rocktortugas at the Ruklys Memorial. {nl}The Rocktortugas in other areas don't give Mano Stones.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000449	Alright. Got the Mano Stones..{nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn Sapper skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000450	You said you want to learn my skills?{nl}If you could bring me some burnable stones from Yonazolems' central district, I'll think about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000451	In other words, it's impossible.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000453	We enhance our immunity by experiencing lots of poisons.{nl}If you could survive from the poison of Rajatoad at the central district, then I will teach you how to control poisons as well.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000466	I need to test if you are qualified to learn my skills. {nl}Defeating Sparnashorn seems fair enough for someone like you, what do you think?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000467	I heard Sparnashorn is huge, so it spends most of its time on the ground rather than in the air.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000468	I didn't expect you to defeat it. That's pretty good. {nl}Alright. You can come anytime you want to learn skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000469	I heard Minotaur have shown up at the Lonesome Marketplace.{nl}Please bring me the proof of your victory.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000475	Unfortunately, we're out of the Nicotia that the Cleric Master is asking for. {nl}There was an urgent request so it had to be used.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000476	But don't worry. {nl}Nicotias grow all over the place so it'll be fine if you just take the young shoots.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000477	Nicotia is not far away from here. {nl}Send my regards to the Cleric Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000478	Thank you. This will help many people in pain. {nl}The goddess will also be glad that you reached a higher level of Cleric.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000479	If you want to step up as a Krivis, then go and worship the goddess Statue in Fedimian. {nl}A pilgrimage is a sure way to fulfill duties to the goddess.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000480	Take the offering before you leave. {nl}The Priest Master and Cleric Master will give you the offering needed for worship.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000481	You're leaving for the pilgrimage. {nl}I can still remember pilgrimage when I was a young clergy.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000482	You can feel your heart filling with faith when you look at the Goddess Statue in Fedimian.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000483	I can give you the offerings.{nl}But before that, I have a favor to ask you. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000484	Residents are complaining about the Rocktortuga running wild in Siauliai Western Woods. {nl}I will give you the offerings if you defeat that monster.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000485	The goddess will also be happy for your mercy.{nl}Here, take the offerings. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000486	The goddess will also be happy for your mercy.{nl}I also want to visit Fedimian again if I could.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000487	You're going on a pilgrimage to Fedimian.{nl}Here, take the offerings.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000488	The Goddess Statue is at the center of Fedimian. {nl}It's huge and wide so be careful not to get lost.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000489	There's an interesting legend about the Goddess Statue in Fedimian. {nl}If you have the opportunity, it'll be good to see it too.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000490	I can feel that you are full of the goddess' blessings. {nl}Good work. Those blessings will lead you to a higher place.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000491	Are you coming from Fedimian? {nl}the Krivis Master is waiting for you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000492	Will you take on the vocation of Priest and follow the path of goddess? {nl}You can do so by getting rid of evil.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000493	Evil forces are showing up in the Starving Demon's Way in Fedimian. {nl}Extract its identity from it and smudge it with the name of goddess.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000494	Anyone who follows the words of the goddess can receive her powers to drive out evil spirits. {nl} But that strength will depend on the depth of one's faith.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000495	Well done. {nl}In the name of the goddess, please judge the evil in this world so they are unable to get a foothold.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000496	If you want to research about the way of Bokor, you should do something for me.{nl}Please get the jewel from the Krivis Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000497	The Bokor Master sent you?{nl}So they have decided to dispose of that jewel.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000498	It will be very dangerous.{nl}You should prepare yourself.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000499	Take it. It is the jewel that is cursed by a vicious being.{nl}Several priests are trying to handle it, but they are having hard time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000500	Since we are also curious about that, please come back sometime later.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000501	I have a bad feeling.{nl}I hope nothing bad occurs...{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000502	You've brought it.{nl}But...damn.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000503	The curse in this jewel is calling Tutu here.{nl}While I figure out how to handle this curse, there is something that you should do.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000504	First, tell the Krivis Master to prepare the memorial service.{nl}After that, please go to the East Siauliai Woods and block Tutu.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000505	Something could happen when the power of the curse gets stronger.{nl}Our mission is to stop that.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000506	Yes. In fact, that jewel is the one that a young priest from the village picked up.{nl}After he brought this jewel, he suffered from nightmares so I made a request to the Bokor Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000507	Okay anyways. I will prepare the memorial service.{nl}Don't worry about it and just block Tutu from the East Siauliai Woods before it comes to Klaipeda.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000508	These things happen because the world is in chaos.{nl}The goddess must feel sad about it...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000509	I cleverly dealt with it because of your help.{nl}As a Bokor, I can expect you to grow from now on.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000510	You defeated that Tutu. Well done.{nl}As a result, I can prepare the memorial service without any problem.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000511	Return to the Bokor Master fast and tell her about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000512	It's good that you are learning skills from me, but I want you to also understand the importance of caring after that.{nl}The priests in Klaipeda requested care for Goddess Statue, how about that?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000513	I want you to get the perfumed oil used for maintaining the statue first.{nl}If you ask the priests, they will give it to you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000514	This is the perfumed oil.{nl}Since Tesla is too old, I was worried that my request may be too much, but I guess it's alright now.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000515	This is all I have..{nl}I heard the Krivis Master also has some.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000516	Perfumed Oil? Ah, here it is.{nl}Please take care of the statue.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000517	Please tell Tesla that I am okay.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000518	Meet the Priest Master too.{nl}The amount of perfumed oil you have may not be enough.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000519	That's the task we entrusted to you, so if you need it we will give to you. {nl}Here you go.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000520	Even if you receive perfumed oil from the Priest Master, it may not be enough.{nl}You should take great care with it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000521	The amount of perfumed oil you have seems a bit lacking.{nl}Since the Bokor Master also has some oil, why don't you go meet him?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000522	Perfumed Oil? we will definitely give it to you.{nl}Tesla told us that he doesn't need any pay for that, so we felt sorry about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000523	Too bad I can't go with you since I don't have enough time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000524	The statues that we entrusted to you are the statue in Fedimian and the statue in Klaipeda.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000525	If you use the absolute power of the goddess, your journey to Fedimian should be a little easier.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000526	Well done.{nl}Return to Tesla.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000527	It is also a task of a Dievdirbys to take care of the work, not just the creation of the work.{nl}Don't forget about this feeling if you want to learn the skills of a Dievdirbys.{nl}{nl}Oh, you came back already. {nl}Well done. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000528	It is also a task of a Dievdirbys to take care of the work, not just the creation of the work.{nl}Don't forget about this feeling if you want to learn the skills of a Dievdirbys.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000529	The number of monsters increased a lot at Starving Demon's Way, and they are threatening the villagers there.{nl}If you want to step forward as a true Sadhu, then share your abilities.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000530	Doing penance is not just for yourself, but to also be kind to others.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000531	As you become kinder to others, you will reach a higher stage.{nl}As the Sadhu Master, I will lead the way for you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000532	First of all, a Paladin shows by acting rather than telling.{nl}Prove your religious belief of the goddess by dueling against me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000533	First of all, the religious belief is the power to us Paladins.{nl}You possess great religious belief.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000534	You passed the test.{nl}You should be prepared for me to train your spirit harder from now on.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000535	Monk Master
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000536	Your religious belief is affirmed when you have a well trained body.{nl}I will test you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000537	Good. Your religious belief is very strong.{nl}I will accept you as a monk. You should be prepared since our training is very hard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000538	Pardoner Master
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000539	Ordinarily, the best way to get accepted as a Pardoner is to contribute a lot of money.{nl}But, I think completing an assignment would be better for you.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000540	Please bring me the fire pot.{nl}I heard a rumor that the merchants in Fedimian saw it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000541	Wow! Welcome.{nl}Do you need anything?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000542	Fire pot? I saw it at Crystal Brook. {nl}The Pardoner Master was looking for it as well. I guess he couldn't find it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000543	Oh, the Pardoner Master. {nl}There's a lot he doesn't know...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000544	Oh. Yes! This is it.{nl}I will accept you as a Pardoner.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000545	Please return to the Pardoner Master.{nl}He was looking for the fire pot for a long time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000546	Fire Pot? Of course I know of it.{nl}But you know I am a merchant. If you could get me the hardened oil from the monsters at Starving Demon's Way...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000547	If you don't need it, then I am okay with it.{nl}Since I am busy, I will just do my work.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000548	Oh, Thank you.{nl}A monster called Mostem keeps his hands on the fire pot at all times.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000549	Ask the equipment merchant over there, he said he saw it recently.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000550	A Wizard is a magician who focus on the basics of all magic.{nl}If you seek a stronger magic, you should go back to the basics.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000551	Please defeat the violent Golem at the West Siauliai Woods.{nl}I will decide whether I will continue to teach you based on your results.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000552	Haha.{nl}I remember when you were a probationary wizard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000553	Yes. Well done.{nl}Let's start from the basics. I will help you to the best of my abilities.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000554	The Poata are threatening the villagers at the East Siauliai Woods.{nl}If you could defeat those monsters in the name of the Goddess Gabija, I will teach you my magic.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000555	One can say that he is stronger upon sharing knowledge with others after learning something.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000556	Well done. The Goddess, Gabija, must be very satisfied.{nl}As promised, I will take you to the next stage of Pyromancer.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000557	You dream to reach a higher stage with the power of chilly air.{nl}Mushcaria at the West Siauliai Woods will be a good assignment for you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000558	It's not good to see a weak human chasing after strength.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000559	You did well without any faults.{nl}As promised, I will train you further.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000560	A Psychokino shows his power by believing in his own abilities.{nl}You gotta show how much you trust yourself to receive my lessons.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000561	The Red Vubbe Warriors in this forest are hard to fight against.{nl}But, if you trust yourself, you will be able to defeat them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000562	How are you going to use this super natural power if you don't trust yourself?{nl}Don't you think so?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000563	Your abilities are way better than I expected.{nl}But, if you learn from me, you can reach a higher stage.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000564	Before you learn magic from me, I want to see how you control mana.{nl}Defeat the Vubbe Warrior at the West Siauliai Woods using any magic you want.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000565	As you know more about a Linker, it is very interesting.{nl}Don't you think so? Reading the string of mana...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000566	You possess great abilities indeed.{nl}As a Linker, if I can lead you well, you will become a really powerful magician.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000567	Before you learn the magic of a Thaumaturge, I need to test your magical skills.{nl}Defeat the Burning Salamanders at the Mage Tower.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000568	It is important to measure your skill.{nl}It will be more important if you don't pass the test.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000569	This is nice.{nl}I will help with my best efforts for your future development.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000570	Instead of bragging about yourself in words, it's much better to show others that you are competent.{nl}I will give you a test. Defeat slimy Reaverpede at the Remaining Tree Dale.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000571	The Reaverpede at the Remaining Tree Dale would be a good fit for your reputation.{nl}I've heard about you enough, but I should check with my own eyes.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000572	Very nice.{nl}You have obtained the right to become stronger with this.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000573	You had better give up if your will is not strong enough.{nl}If that's not the case, defeat the Devilglove that is around here.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000574	Evil spirits are just tools.{nl}I will not do anything that would turn my back on the goddess.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000575	You really use every possible means.{nl}Well, we are the same about that. I will permit you to learn magic from me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000576	I have prepared something nice down there for someone who would become my disciple.{nl}From there, pick up some corpse fragments. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000577	Being a Necromancer is really nice.{nl}But, using humans as ingredients is absolutely forbidden.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000578	Very nice indeed.{nl}You have no problem understanding my spells.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000579	Chronomancer Master
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000580	If you want to learn my magic, I should first understand your skills.{nl}Defeating Reaverpede at the Remaining Tree Dale should be enough.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000581	No matter how strong a magic is, it can not stop time from flowing.{nl}But, it could be possible if it were Agailla Flurry's work...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000582	You did way better than I expected.{nl}I will acknowledge your skills. Please follow my teachings closely from now on.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000583	I don't know if those Masters really think about the safety of the goddess and the kingdom.{nl}Ironbaum is approaching Klaipeda, but no one is worried about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000584	That attitude is what I wanted.{nl}I will teach you the true magic if you defeat Ironbaum at the West Siauliai Woods.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000585	Especially the attitude of the Cryomancer Master really...pisses me off.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000586	I remember when you first arrived in Klaipeda.{nl}If you want, you can start the training right away.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000587	Ironbaum is running around the East Siauliai Woods rignt now.{nl}But, the Chronomancer Master is not doing anything about it.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000588	I know it is little ridiculous to ask a favor to a person whom has come to learn my magic, but I have no other choice.{nl}I want you to defeat Ironbaum to teach him a lesson.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000589	Klaipeda may fall into danger, but he only cares about his safety. That's pathetic.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000590	Well done.{nl}The Cryomancer Master woudn't stand and watch now since the Pyromancer trainee also stepped forward.{nl}Until then, let's talk about fire magic in detail.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000591	The other masters are all blaming me.{nl}They told me that I am not doing anything even when those monsters are threatening Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000592	Do I have to face against those weak monsters?{nl}If you can take care of them, I will teach you the magic of the Choronomancer.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000593	It's called Ironbaum and it is located at the West Siauliai Woods.{nl}Even if I am not interested in it, I can't help listening since I am not deaf.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000594	I wonder what the Pyromancer Master would think when looking at the defeated Ironbaum.{nl}I will teach you the magic of Chronomancer as I promised.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000595	I have a request that I don't want to lose to the Linker Master.{nl}If you could take care of that request on behalf of me, I will teach you how to control your energy. How about it?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000596	It is not that hard.{nl}You just have to defeat the Werewolf that is walking around this mine village.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000597	I had troubles with that a few times in the past.{nl}But if I have a disciple like you, I won't lose to the Linker Master anymore.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000598	That's nice!{nl}Leave the Linker Master and let's talk about energy in details.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000599	If you want to learn about my magic, there is something that you should do for me.{nl}Defeat the Werewolf that appeared in the Miners' Village quicker than the Psychokino Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000600	The Werewolf is not easy, but you will be able to defeat it.{nl}You applied to become a Linker right?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000601	Well done. I wonder what the Psychokino Master will feel after looking at the defeated Werewolf.{nl}I will teach you my magic as I promised to you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000602	Monsters are causing chaos near Fedimian.{nl}As a result, the masters are working together to defeat them.{nl}How about it, if you are an applicant to become a Thaumaturge, I think you should also help.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000603	Oh, that's very brave of you! {nl}Defeat the Netherbovine at Faultline, and then I will advance you when you return.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000604	Good. You are qualified as a Thaumaturge.{nl}As I promised, I will advance you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000605	All the masters in Fedimian are chasing after the monsters that are causing chaos.{nl}You should defeat those monsters before anybody to learn my magic.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000606	The monster is called Netherbovine. {nl}According to a reliable source, it appeared at Faultline recently.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000607	I can still picture the faces of the other masters.{nl}Not only that, I am also happy to get a good disciple.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000608	It doesn't make sense to stay in a safe place as a master when there are hordes of monsters.{nl}I thought that wasn't right so I ran from Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000609	I heard that Necroventer appeared again at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}If you dream to be a sorcerer, I hope you follow my request.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000610	It is silly to stay in a safe place as a master.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000611	I understand your point.{nl}I will teach you magic as I had promised.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000612	I can teach you my magic whenever you want.{nl}But, I am not sure if you can follow my lead well.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000613	If that's the case, please defeat Necroventer that appeared at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}I can teach you my magic when you can do that.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000614	You are better than I expected.{nl}But, the magic to control time is really difficult so you should be prepared.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000615	Long time no see. You want to be an Alchemist.{nl}I should test if you are worthy enough to be an Alchemist.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000616	Good.{nl}Please defeat the Werewolf that is making a mess around here.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000617	It is not hard to learn the knowledge of an Alchemmist.{nl}You can learn the basics, such as decomposition of an element and synthesis, slowly.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000618	Good. I am looking forward to your future.{nl}I will advance you to Alchemist.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000619	You should prove your determination to remove evil in order to follow the training of a priest.{nl}Please get pouches imbued with Magi from the Vubbes at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000620	Please talk to the elder of the Crystal Mine if you have a hard time entering the Crystal Mine.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000621	I will purify these pockets so that they won't release demonic power anymore.{nl}Brother, I welcome you to be a priest.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000622	Brother. You came far to learn the religious belief of a Krivis, but I don't have the time to greet you at the moment.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000623	One of our brothers who was bringing back a sacred relic has disappeared.{nl}I've been praying for the mercy of the goddess. Can you find our brother?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000624	Krivis Brother
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000625	Don't come near!{nl}The monsters that are after the sacred relic are coming!
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000626	I was so afraid that I would not be able to bring the sacred relic to Klaipeda.{nl}Brother, you must be a messenger that the goddess sent.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000627	The last call stopped at the Crystal Mine.{nl}The brother should be safe...I am so worried.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000628	I have a lot more to do.{nl}Don't worry, please pass this sacred relic to the Krivis Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000629	How can I say that this object is more important than a person.{nl}This is all due to the blessing of the goddess that our brother is safe.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000630	Anyway, we welcome you to be a member of the Krivis.{nl}The goddess must be happy to see you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000631	You should prove that you are suited to use a sword if you want to reach a higher level of swordsmanship.{nl}Please obtain the heart of Stone Orca at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000661	It is strange that a skillful person like you would learn from me.{nl}But, there is a cost to any learning.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000662	I heard the Poata at the Layered Rock Forest attack people.{nl}It would be more than enough if you could defeat them.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000664	If you want to learn from me, you must first show me your skills.{nl}I think defeating Colimencia at the Layered Rock Forest would be more than enough.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000681	I lost an important sacred relic of the Krivis.{nl}If you want to reach a higher stage of Krivis, I will help you find the sacred relic again.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000682	There is a strong power within the sacred relic so lots of monsters are pursuing it for themselves.{nl}Losing a sacred relic is like losing your faith.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000688	The petrified whale at Lonesome Marketplace has taken many lives.{nl}I need the essence that has the resentment from them in it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000689	Well done.{nl}I will teach you everything about Bokor as promised.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000696	I heard enough about you, that you have a firm religious belief.{nl}But I want to check it with my own eyes.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000697	Forgive me. I am being picky since this task is in the name of Paladin.{nl}I think defeating Rajapearl at the Lonesome Marketplace would be enough to prove yourself, given your reputation.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000698	Prove your religious belief.{nl}There's nothing to be worried about. The goddess will protect you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000699	You have done well.{nl}With this, your religious belief is proven, so I will accept you to learn my lessons.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000701	Our training is very harsh. {nl}You should at least defeat Repus at the central district to follow our training.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000702	Good. I will accept your determination.{nl}I always tell you, but our Monk training is really harsh.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000703	Insteand of an entrance test for Pardoner, there's something you should do for me. {nl}Please find the lost money of indulgence at Ruklys street. You can do it right?

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000722	{S35} {nl} The Fletcher Master and Lydia Schaffen {/}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000723	Even if someone becomes the world's greatest archer, consumption of arrows will always be a problem. {nl} Lydia Schaffen's bow was used with great care. However, Schaffen too, uses arrows. {nl} But unlike fired arrows, Her bow is permanent even with continued use.  {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000724	Even if it was impossible to create arrows that can be used permanently, Lydia Schaffen delved into arrow crafting techniques. {nl} Obtaining materials neccesary to craft arrows was another problem. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000725	Troubled greatly by this problem, Lydia Schaffen went on a journey to find the solution. {nl} Whether or not she had been granted blessing by the goddess when she met the Fletcher Master or if she found the solution to her problem, Historians will continue to debate about the topic. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000726	Many Fletchers had been produced ever since the dawn of time. But talentless numbers are irrelevant. {nl} People just call him the Fletcher Master, Lydia Schaffen too,was uncertain of his name. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000727	Ever since his rise to fame, People called him the Fletcher Master. People who knew his real name were swept away by the passings of the river of time. {nl} His real name, according to some scholars, was said to be John Blacksmith. but the name itself isn't getting any credibility, since you cannot readily accept a famous name that common. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000728	Anyway, Lydia Schaffen met this the Fletcher Master who was an arrow expert. Lydia after overcoming her journey, was ready to learn. {nl} However, arrow crafting techniques by the Fletcher Master was a secret at that time, and in the years afterwards, a stuff among legends. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000729	However, even if you are the world's greatest archer, the goddess' blessing is important to learn the arrow crafting techniques of the Fletcher Master. {nl} Therefore only someone who has the blessing of the goddess can be molded to create a the Fletcher Master, like how Lydia Schaffen created new and consistent arrows. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000730	Another tale is of the Fletcher Master's secret to avoid combat according to the maker's manual is to hit with certainty somewhere in the spleen. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000731	The rapid production of arrows by the Fletcher Master is regarded to be his sole talent. However he may have a secret lying in wait somewhere in this world. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000732	Lydia Schaffen Crossroads
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000733	{S35} {nl} Lydia Schaffen Crossroads {/}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000734	This is a record to the Royal Family about a story when King Kadumel asked Lydia Schaffen whether she can hit a target behind a boulder or a tree, and how she simply answered the King with the crisp sound of her arrow hitting the target. However, there are some written inconsistencies from the royal record and the folklore. That is, King Kadumel noted at the time, he was not giving Schaffen a test of her abilities with a bow.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000735	A more important fact is what sort of target Lydia Schaffen hit. Or to put it more precisely, who she hit, would be of great significance.{nl}Whenever the royal records and the folklore handle this story, they do not reference the time when it arose.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000736	Both versions simply introduce the heroic story by focusing on Lydia Schaffen's great bow skills.{nl}There is a certain reason for this.{nl} The reason is that this story happened in the final days of the Civil War. Differing from the known folklore, Ruklys was not killed by King Kadumel's soldiers in the last layer of the Fortress of the Land. It is said that Ruklys had a particular reason for not letting any outsiders into the heart of his fort.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000737	Rather than dying, Ruklys escaped moments before his fort was overrun, and King Kadumel ordered his soldiers to go pursue him.{nl} After the pursuit, Ruklys found himself cornered at the edge of a cliff.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000738	There was a large enough rock on the cliff for Ruklys to put his back against while facing the cliff and keeping the King's soldiers at the opposite face of the rock.{nl} Ruklys leaned his back on the rock so the King's archer who tracked him could not attack.{nl} If it were a different location they could have gone to the left and right to surround and rain arrows, but the cliff, alongside the battle formation, was not a place for such attacks.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000739	Having no archers who could shoot across the air beyond the cliff, King Kadumel unquestionably drove his soldiers towards the edge of the cliff.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000740	However Ruklys and his remaining men repelled the King's soldiers, showing their inhuman ability to persist day and night. This even caused the King's peasant soldiers to begin to waver.{nl} Furthermore, Ruklys' heroic struggle made such an impression to some of Kadumel's men and officers, that some started questioning Kadumel's command.{nl} Already unpopular among people under his rule, King Kadumel could not continue pushing his men to their death, he also could not wait until Ruklys died of hunger or fatigue.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000741	And through this situation, King Kadumel asked a clever question to Lydia Schaffen.{nl}  Of course, Lydia did not take King Kadumel's provocation as a chance to show her skills and fire a meek high angle shot to kill Ruklys. There were other reasons that were overlapping here.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000742	But considering these reasons, in any case, such as having her master's wishes, or the thought that she ended someone's life through her own hands, we as the current generation can only guess how hurt and conflicted were Lydia Schaffen's emotions. Henceforth, people became knowledgeable of the time when Lydia Schaffen easily pierced a target behind a boulder from the crossroads, however, Lydia would bear an immeasurable complex emotion about the crossroads from that day forward.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000743	Lydia Schaffen's Notch
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000744	{s35}{nl}Lydia Schaffen's Notch{/}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000745	This story is said to have taken place one day at the Astral Tower.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialogue is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000746	'You are forgetting the basics of archery. What is an archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an archer? In the end, archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000747	The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000748	However, calling a catapult or a crossbow a weapon anyone can handle is not correct.{nl}You claim archery exists solely because there are tools, this is wrong.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000749	This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000750	The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000751	From then on, the disciples argued to no end, claims became more diverse and interesting, theories fired back and forth.{nl}Finally, they started wondering about what their master, Lydia Schaffen, would think of this.{nl}After having told her about the discussion they've had so far, they waited for her reply.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000752	When the disciples came to Lydia Schaffen, she is said to have been eating chestnuts using an arrowhead, dangerously perched on the railing of the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000753	Lydia Schaffen continued eating while listening to the disciples, keeping her position on the railing. After they finished, she kept quiet for a while, but before long she fiddled with her fingers through the pile of shells of chestnuts she had eaten and picked out something, reportedly saying this: {nl}'What is this?'{nl}The disciple with the sharp eyes answered before anyone could.{nl}'It's the inner skin of a chestnut.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000754	It was very obvious that it was indeed the inner skin of a chestnut, so the others nodded in agreement and waited for their master's next words. {nl}And so Lydia Schaffen continued. {nl}'No. This is the notch of my arrow.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000755	Having said so, she pinched the inner skin of a chestnut between her fingers, took her bow that was lying beside her as always and fired into the sky using the inner skin as a notch. {nl}It is said that Lydia Schaffen has settled the dispute of the disciples that way, jumped from the railing she was sitting on and left, leaving the disciples bewildered.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000756	Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000757	{s35}Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin {/} 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000758	This is a story about Lydia Schaffen that has been handed down throughout the Kingdom. {nl}Furthermore, while there are places that Lydia Schaffen has never been to according to historical records, there are stories about what happened when she visited their village.{nl}These stories contain absurd things such as dragons appearing, a strange demon which is different from the demon we know laying a wager with Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000759	In spite of that, the villagers from the region believe the story beyond doubt, and they embrace the pride that this story about Lydia Schaffen brings, having originated from their hometown.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000760	Compared to Ruklys, who likely died early on during the Civil War, or Flurry, who rarely left the tower she built, Lydia Schaffen definitely went on a greater number of adventures around the world, making her the most suitable as the protagonist of a story.{nl}This is one of those stories.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000761	It is not known how true the story really is. Perhaps it was just as absurd in the past as it would definitely be absurd in the present. Still, the fact that it is still told today means the story agrees with the nature of Lydia Schaffen.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000762	One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000763	The traveler had met a demon named Rumpelstiltskin when passing through the forest several days ago. {nl}Then he was lured into playing a game with the demon. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000764	The reward for winning the game was significant, but the game with the demon was not easy. In the end, the traveler lost to Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}The traveler kept sighing as he waited for Rumpelstiltskin to come back. {nl} After hearing the traveler's story, Lydia Schaffen decided to confront the demon. She promised to the traveler that she'll help him with all her might. Some time passed, and Rumpelstiltskin appeared.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000765	Lydia offered Rumpelstiltskin to let the traveler go and play a game with her in exchange. {nl}For better or for worse, Rumpelstiltskin was well aware of Lydia Schaffen's reputation, and the fact that she requested a game with him excited him into accepting her request. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000766	In the past, Rumpelstiltskin was quite famous for challenging his opponents to use their best skill and then defeating them. {nl} But, he changed the rules of his game a bit every time. {nl} Lydia Schaffen asked: 'I understand that you want to challenge my archery skill, so what are we going to do?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000767	'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000768	Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000769	'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000770	After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000771	Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000772	Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike archery skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000773	Her arrows poured faster than heavy rain during a hot summer day, as if hundreds, or even thousands of arrows were fired at the same time in the same direction. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000774	Rumpelstiltskin couldn't take it as calmly this round. Faster than the human eye could distinguish, Rumpelstiltskin landed on each arrow one by one and transferred to another as the barrage cut through the air. In the end, he was able to get onto the last arrow before it reached the last pine cone.{nl}Rumpelstiltskin spoke to Lydia Schaffen while trying to catch his breath.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000775	'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000776	Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on...'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000777	'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended...'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000778	Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is... the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000779	And, as he rode the arrow towards the moon, Rumpelstiltskin also realized the fact that the game couldn't end until he reached it.{nl}As time passed, the power of the arrow subsided and it began falling towards the ground. However, after a time the arrow that Rumpelstiltskin rode on stopped still, floating in the sky.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000780	Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000781	According to the anecdote, Rumpelstiltskin has not reached the moon yet, and is still flying there using the magic in his body. {nl}One can only guess if he will manage to return before his demonic life span ends.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000782	Nevertheless, as we know, Lydia Schaffen has passed away long ago. So while the demon did not lose the game, he has lost his chance to win the game forever. {nl}Still, the one matter left that we, as the current generation, are curious about is what the agreed penalty between Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin was. {nl}Of course, we could ask a particular person, err, demon, that may or may not still be alive. However, as we do not know when he will return, it will be hard to settle this lingering matter for quite some time.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000783	The Expansion of Atman
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000784	The Expansion of Atman
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000785	Congratulations on receiving this book, which no criminal may see. There are many ways to use magic, but the magic used by Linkers are a particular case. Other mages exercise effect-based powers rather than magic. That is to say, to fight an enemy with a fireball, or with lightning, does not truly bind the enemy with magic. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000786	These attacks only use magic to make a fireball and lightning. Then, the mages control the magical energy's direction and destination, releasing it after settling on both.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000787	In other words, these mages are unable to handle enemies without Linkers; as they need to channel and regulate surrounding energy, these mages do not have the time to easily handle targeting their magic towards an enemy. However, as you have chosen to walk the path of the Linker, the way of your magic will differ completely. The way of a Linker's magic is by directly linking your magic with your opponent's magic, which includes searching for your target within seconds.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000788	Also, in the case of linking more than 2 targets, a Linker's way of magic is complicated even further if the targets have mutually opposing properties. In these situations, the Linker must use a viable magical property to connect the targets with opposing properties.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000789	Thus to some extent, the Linkers are experienced magic users who still have a lot of new fields to test. Even if there are those predestined to be Linkers, fledging mages who have developed their abilities to control magic are recommended becoming Linkers and walking the path of a Linker. Above all, the most important matter about Linkers is the establishment of their truly resolved soul, or Atman. Without it, it is possible for attacks directed at a magically linked target to return towards the Linker.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000790	For this reason, Linkers differ from other mages in which they must remember to use their magically established self as a tool. Particularly, when you must face other Linkers, your Atman is even more important.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000791	Congratulations again on receiving this book. The fact that you were able to find this book means that you have successfully found some sort of link between the visible world and the invisible world. Consequently, if you experience difficulty searching for a magical linkage point within a group of targets hereafter, it'll become easier to cast away insincerity.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000793	Armor from the Kadumel Era{/}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000794	{nl}{nl}Vados Winterspoon
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000795	{nl}{nl}10 years have passed since I began my research. Now, exactly 30 years after the Civil War, I finally have results to show.{nl}Although the purpose of this research is to satisfy my small curiosity, if the scope were to be broadened, it may prove beneficial to the Winterspoon family.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000796	Anyway, after spending a long time searching every nook and cranny for information about Ruklys and his followers, I reached a conclusion.{nl}*These notes were compiled after the... from King Kadumel's men..., on the assumption that there are no contradictions.*{nl}During the period when the Civil War took place, there weren't any significant differences between the King's army and rebel army.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000797	Both sides had armaments of comparable quality.{nl} King Kadumel's army outnumbered the rebel army, but the Fortress of the Land and its surrounding city (now called Petrified City) was a favourable position to be situated in.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000798	Many of the attackers had to attack through a funnel, is my conclusion.{nl}These tactics reduced the numerical advantage from 10-to-1 to 3-to-1. *Ruklys intended to make a heroic defense in the Fortress of the Land*, The likelihood of victory is not great, even with 20 times the amount of troops. A theory commonly accepted by military scholars.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000799	King Kadumel had a numerical advantage in troops, but other factors involved are just as important.{nl}A significant difference, for example, is how wars are fought now compared to a thousand years ago.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000800	There have been many advances in military science, but the changes created by the development of the magical academy is incomparable. Warfare with magicians as combatants add a lot more elements for commanders to consider.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000801	This was the key difference between the armies of Ruklys and King Kadumel.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000802	If one side had magicians whereas the other side did not, the difference between troops and equipment is meaningless. It is estimated that the number of magicians in King Kadumel's army was substantial.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000803	*Although Ruklys' mentor was against fighting an army that has a considerable number of magicians, the war could not be avoided.*
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000804	Typically, the number of soldiers and their equipment greatly influences the tide of battle; however, with the inclusion of magicians, such was not the case as it turns out during the civil war.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000805	This phenomenon creates some issues to how the past was analyzed. If King Kadumel had not properly utilized the magicians, then it would be his folly and incompetence. As for the exceptional bravery Ruklys demonstrated, there may be another explanation to it.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000806	The perspectives like those are not all invalid. However, one thing must be said about the result of this research. That is the metal Ruklys and his followers used for their armor.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000807	The purpose of the research is to examine why magic was not effective in the battle against Ruklys and his followers.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000808	In other words, it's a possibility that Ruklys' forces were armed with Mana Metal powerful enough to negate the magical attacks of magicians.{nl}At first, this may sound absurd.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000809	The fact that a metal, Mana Metal, with such high resistance against magic exists is strange, but if such a metal does exist, then there couldn't have been enough to make more than one set of armor. The commander, Ruklys, would have been the only one wearing such an armor, otherwise it wouldn't make sense if the Mana Metal were distributed to that many of his troops.{nl}It is just as reasonable that the opposite was true.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000810	If one were to write about this, he/she can think of an objection to this immediately.{nl}In order to support this claim, one would need to find evidence of such a phenomena.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000811	If I personally have not reached the conclusion myself, I would not have believe such wild hypothesis.{nl} What we have discovered was that the particular type of Mana Metal does not become fractured in the extreme cold temperatures. Other seemingly sturdy metals are highly vulnerable to extreme temperatures. No matter how strong a certain type of metal is, it will crack into many pieces at cold temperatures.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000812	However, the Mana Metal Ruklys collected did not have such a weakness.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000813	Upon visiting the location of the Fortress of the Land, my conclusion was proven correct. Pieces of the Mana Metal were found. I believe that they were used in battle. My hypothesis is that a small amount of the Mana Metal is sufficient to protect against the Kings' magician's wide area magic spells.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000814	Let's move our focus unto Ruklys. According to credible records, all the magic attacks even from the royal magicians were useless against Ruklys so the casualty toll kept rising until they had to use Lydia Schadden's arrow. Such supports my hypothesis.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000815	Judging from the clues discovered, Ruklys should have been wearing magic resistant armor at the time.{nl}{nl}Combined with other clues during that period of time, the armor Ruklys was wearing must have been produced using a large amount of Mana Metal.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002969	There's something I am preparing right now so I should meet someone, but he can't be contacted lately.{nl}I want to go and check him myself, but since the task I am preparing is being progressed quietly, I can't go there since I will be spotted by lots of people.{nl}Can you go there for me?

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002971	Damn... I don't want to believe it, but according to what you just told me, it seems that he died due to the attacks from the monsters.{nl}I guess I should contact General Ramin with another method.{nl}Ah, and please keep this secret to other people.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002972	Of course, I didn't forget the promise to you.{nl}I will help you to grow up to be a better Doppelsoeldner.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002973	I am researching about the eternal life recently.{nl}I am investigating various documents, but it will be the best to listen from the one who is living an eternal life.{nl}I want to listen from a few of Amjinas that are still present in this world...{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002974	It's not good for me to visit them as a master and we masters were separated for a long time.{nl}This is also a part of the research as a Sorcerer so ask them how they live eternal lives.{nl}If you could do that for me, I will upgrade your abilities as a Sorcerer one level up.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002975	Among the Amjinas, the whereabouts of the Dievdirbys Master from the West Siauliai Woods, the Necromancer Master at Mullers Passage, and the Chronomancer Master at Stele Road have been confirmed.{nl}Ask each of them how they live an eternal life.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002979	{nl}If you are okay, could you help me with this task little more?{nl}If that's so, I will finish it quickly and help you.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002982	It's been recorded completely.{nl}Good. I will pass this to the Alchemist Master.{nl}Now is my turn to help you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002983	The power of Necromancer will always be expressed through the materials that act as catalysts.{nl}That power will be influenced by the abilities of Necromancer himself and his power.{nl}If you want to advance more as a Necromancer, it's important that you obtain those materials.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002987	So you've come here to learn higher level abilities of Alchemist.{nl}But, there's something I should do fast so I can't teach at the moment.{nl}It could be dangerous if I leave it like that so I am trying to finish it quickly.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002988	Could you help for the task?{nl}If that's so, I will teach you the abilities of Alchemist as a return.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002989	So the Alchemist Master sent you here?{nl}I've prepared it since the head of the Winterspoon family requested it.{nl}Please go back with this.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002990	Good.{nl}I am investigating Crystal Mine... I need the orb that records the memories of the Chronomancer Master.{nl}He is the head of our Winterspoon family so I've requested it to him in advance. Tell him that I've sent you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002991	Lucid... Actually have you met the Chronomancer Master well?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002992	You've brought the orb well.{nl}The orb that records the past has the power to read the memories of the possessor and record.{nl}If it acknowledges you as its possessor, it will read the memories and if there's more to be investigated, you should find them on your own.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002993	Explore all the areas in the 1st district and the 2nd district in Crystal Mine with this orb.{nl}If you've explored it completely in the past, the orb will read the memories of the possessor and record the past.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002995	I want to check this right away, but I guess I should keep the promise with you first.{nl}I will teach you the abilities of Alchemist.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002996	This story is said to have taken place one day at the Astral Tower.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialog is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002997	'You are forgetting the basics of archery. What is an archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an archer? In the end, archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002998	The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002999	This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an Archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003000	The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003001	Lydia Schaffen continued eating while listening to the disciples, keeping her position on the railing. After they finished, she kept quiet for a while, but before long she fiddled with her fingers through the pile of shells of chestnuts she had eaten and picked out something, reportedly saying this: {nl}'What is this?'{nl}The disciple with the sharp eyes answered before anyone could.{nl}'It's the inner skin of a chestnut.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003002	It was very obvious that it was indeed the inner skin of a chestnut, so the others nodded in agreement and waited for their master's next words. {nl}And so Lydia Schaffen continued. {nl}'No. This is the notch of my arrow.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003003	One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003004	In the past, Rumpelstiltskin was quite famous for challenging his opponents to use their best skill and then defeating them. {nl} But, he changed the rules of his game a bit every time. {nl} Lydia Schaffen asked: 'I understand that you want to challenge my archery skill, so what are we going to do?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003005	'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003006	Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003007	'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003008	After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003009	Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003010	Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike archery skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003011	'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003012	Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on...'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003013	'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended...'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003014	Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is... the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003015	Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.
